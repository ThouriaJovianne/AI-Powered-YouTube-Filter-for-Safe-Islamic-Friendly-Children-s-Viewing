"Assalamu Alaikum,
December, which most people refer to as the month of Christmas. Christian people celebrate 25th December for
the birth of Jesus (pbuh). Even though Muslims show the greatest respect
to Prophet Isa or Jesus (pbuh), there are some reasons, why Muslims don't celebrate
Christmas. First we need to know the history of the date,
December 25th. Fact no 1: From the beginning of time, people
were excited about the powerful Sun, Moon and stars. Onetime Satan convinced some of the people
to believe that the Sun, Moon and stars are their gods. So they started to worship them. Later some smart people started to learn more
about the Sun, Moon and stars and their movements throughout the year. Finally they discovered that during December,
the daylight became shorter and shorter and Dec 21st become the shortest daylight of the
whole year. So Satan convinced the people, that the Sun
died on this day. For the next three days, the length of daylight
did not change, up until when December 25th came, the daylight began to get longer again. So Satan convinced the people that, after
3 days and 3 nights, the sun got its life back on the 25th of December. And some of the bad people started to believe
in Satan and started to celebrate December 25th as the Sun's birthday. Fact No. 2: During those olden days, the people
who believed in the Sun and the moon as their gods, they had three main figures for their
worship; the father, mother and son. They believed that the Father was the Sun,
which was the god, the mother as the moon which was the god's wife and for the son it's
interesting. They thought when god wanted to come into
this world to help the humans; he had to go into his wife's belly, so that his wife could
become pregnant. The god stayed in his wife's belly for nine
months, and then he came out from his wife's belly as a little helpless baby. So they thought that the baby was the son
of god and also the main god in a human body. Once the baby grew up he was unfortunately
killed in his young age. But after 3 days and 3 nights he was born
again and said 'hi' to his people then left the earth and went to heaven. Fact No. 3: Throughout different places around
the earth, somehow, the people worshiping this idea of the god going inside the wife's
belly and coming out as a little baby became common to several parts of the world, however
with different names. In Egypt the mother would be called Isis and
the son would be called Osiris. In India, they used the different names along
with places like China, Japan, Greece, and Rome as well. In Babylon the mother’s name was Ishtar,
the son’s name was Tammuz and the father name is Nimrod. Fact No. 4: Since many of the places had adopted
the same story all throughout the world from those olden days, almost all of their gods
birthdays became December 25th. Fact No. 5: Historians say, that all of these
crazy ideas of worshipping sun and moon came from Nimrod and his wife. It was the time during prophet Ibrahim (pbuh),
and the bad king Nimrod claimed that he was the Sun and the people's god. Onetime he even argued with the prophet for
that. You can find that story in the Quran Surah
Baqara verse 258. Fact No. 6: After Nimrod was killed by his
enemy, Nimrod's wife started saying that Nimrod did not die, and he had returned to his own
place, the sun. She started to say that from that point, his
name would be ""Baal"", the sun god. Later when she gave birth to a son, Tammuz,
she told to the people that, her husband Nimrod was reborn as a human God to save the world. And his birthday was 25th December. Fact No.7: Now you might be a little confused
since this video was suppose to be about Christmas and why Muslims don't celebrate it. But the point is that Christmas falls under
the date of December 25th. So far all we discussed are from Christian
historian and researchers. And they all don't know the real birthday
of Prophet Jesus (pbuh). Some historians say that Isa or Jesus (pbuh)
was born in April while others say he was born in August. But almost all of the Christian historians
agree that Jesus (pbuh) did not born in December. So then, now we need to know why it is that
the people celebrate his birthday on December 25th. Fact No8: A long time ago the Romans used
to celebrate a one week evil festival around the 25th of December for their Sun god Saturn. Around 400 years after Prophet Jesus’ (pbuh)
birth, Christianity began to control most of Europe. The priest did not like the Roman evil festival. So they made a plan to stop that evil festival. The Christian priest created a false birthday
for Jesus (pbuh), so that the people wouldn't be celebrating the festival for their Sun
god Saturn. They made it so that the festival would be
for the Son or the child of god, Jesus. May Allah (swt) save us from that evil thinking. Ordinary people just wanted to have fun and
enjoy their time. For them it was not a big deal whose birthday
was celebrated. And that's how Christmas has started to be
celebrated on 25th of December. Day by day, this newly created festival turned
to be a crazy and violent festival. For thousands of years it was a very scary
festival. Drunk people were on the streets doing the
all kinds of bad jobs. So when the colonists from England came to
America for the first time, they ordered people so that there would be no more Christmas celebrations
in the new world of America. During the 1900s, when a lot of immigrants
started to come to America from different places, they brought with them their different
culture, and that is how Christmas slowly started to become celebrated in America. And just a little fun fact, Alabama was the
first state to approve Christmas to be celebrated as a public holiday in 1836. Fact no9.: So because of the old crazy history
and Jesus (pbuh)'s made up birthday, there are many Christians who don't celebrate Christmas
as their holiday. Fact no 10: In Islam, any made up creation
in the name of religion is not allowed. And if people start saying false information
in the name of religion, that is completely forbidden. So most of the Muslim Scholars try to teach
to be careful to involve in manmade religious festivals. Muslim don't need any false information to
make prophet Jesus (pbuh) great, because he is already one of the great prophets selected
by the one and only God Allah (swt). Each and every Muslim has to respect Jesus
(pbuh) as one of the great prophets and believe in his miraculous birth and all of the great
miracles done by him with the help of the true God Allah (swt). And Muslims have to pray for him whenever
any Muslim even mentions his name, Jesus (pbuh). Now, that we know the history behind this
date, you should decide for yourself, should Muslims involve in a celebration with the
date of December 25th?"

How Prophet Celebrated Eid In Islam, Eid started 14 years after Muhammad
(s)'s prophet hood. After he moved to Medina during his 2nd year
Allah (swt) gave two of the blessing Eids to Muslims. One is Eid ul Fitr and the second is Eid al
Adha. During the morning of Eid right before going
to prayer Muslims used to take a bath and put on their best clothing. And then before leaving for 'Eid ul Fitr'
prayer, prophet Muhammad (s) used to eat dates. Which had later became the famous tradition
of having sweets during the Eid day. For the Eid prayer, the prophet used to choose
a very big open place which was close to the Mosque, in order to have many people at the
Eid prayer. Because he encouraged everybody, men, women
and children to come to the Eid prayer. He even encouraged that those who cannot pray,
that they should sit at the back and wait to listen the prophet's speech. While listening to the prophet, everyone hoped
to get the blessings of the Eid day and purified themselves out of their sins. He used to pray two rakahs of prayer then
stand up and turn to the people for his speech which had very powerful advice for the Muslims. Then he went to the women section to give
advice for the women. During the day of Eid, he used to say ""Allahuakbar""
many times. Prophet used to hug and pray for each other
during the special days. During the Eid celebration he used to pay
special attention to children, by giving Salam to them, talking to them, joking with them
and giving presents to them. The prophet always used to spend some of his
time with his friends and visited their houses during Eid. He also invited people to his house, shared
his food and had a good time with them. If there were any sick people, he always visited
them. Prophet Muhammad (s) wanted Muslims to visit
graveyard and pray for their dead relatives and think about death. Prophet Muhammad (s) used to take one road
going to the Eid prayer and took another road when he returned. The Muslims also used to pay their Zakat ul
Fitr to the poor people to purify their fasting before Eid prayer. One time during the Eid celebration, two women
came in Aisha (pbuh)'s house and they sang songs. After some time prophet Muhammad (s) came
to the house. He laid down on the bed and turned his face
to other side. Then Aisha (pbuh)'s father Abu Bakr came in
the house and saw some of the girls were singing. He became very upset and told his daughter
Aisha (pbuh) to stop. Then the prophet told Abu Bakr (pbuh) to leave
them alone and let them sing. During the Eid day, a group of people from
Ethiopia were performing the spear and shield game in the mosque. Then Prophet and his wife Aisha (pbut) decided
to see the game. Omar (pbuh) wanted to stop the performance
but Muhammad (s) gave them permission to continue their game. Prophet that Eid is the day of peace, happiness
and joy. That’s why he celebrated  Eid with  many  people and had a great joy in the  blessing holiday."

Night of Qadr Allah (swt) talk about the great Qadr night
in Surah 97. The whole Surah talked about that night. This Qadr nigh is the highest respected night
of the year. Because it is the first night when Allah (swt)
started to send the Quran from the very protected place the lohe mahfooz. This is the most blessed night of the year. It is so blessed night that if we luckily
could get that night and pray for Allah (swt) from out heat, all our previous sin would
be removed. In this night Allah (swt) send millions and
billions of Angel to this night for our good. In Ibn Kasir we find a story about Surah Qadr. One night Muhammad (swt) was taking to some
of the Sahabes about the 4 great prophets who were from Bani Israel. They were prophet Ayub, Zakaria, Hiskeel and
Yusha (pbut). Those 4 great prophets prayed and followed
Allah (swt)' law and order long 80 years. In that time they never disobeyed Allah (swt)
law, not even a single second. All the Sahabes were very surprised to hear
that. Then angel Jirael (pbuh) came to Muhammad
(s) and told Muslims have more great news than that. Then he read Surah Qadr. After hearing that everybody became very happy. Because in this Surah Allah (swt) told this
Qadr night is more better than thousand months or 83 years. If someone prays this night, it's like he
prays more than 83 years. We need to understand it is not only 83 years. It is more and more than that. Basically, this night is more than our whole
life. Sometimes people die at a very young age. But at old time, people used to live a very
long life. So they could pray more and got more reward. But now we can get more reward because of
this great Qadar night. This great blessing night is in the month
of Ramadan. One day Allah (swt) gave the information of
exact day of Qadr night. After knowing that great news, Muhammad (s)
was coming to Sahabas to tell the exact night of Qadr. But on the way he saw two men were arguing
with each other. Allah (swt) did not like that and didn't want
to give us exact night of Qadr. So, as Allah (swt)'s plan, on the way Muhammad
(s) forgot the exact night of Qadr. But from many Hadith we can tell that, this
Qadar night could be any night of last ten days of Ramadan. In one hadith Our prophet Mohammad (S) told
us to search the Qadr night in the odd number of nights, in the last ten nights of Ramadan. So we can find the blessing Qadr night in
the last 5 odd number nights of Ramadan, like 21, 23, 25, 27 or 29th night of Ramadan. No way, we should not miss the great gift
from Allah (swt) for us the most blessing Qadr night. Inhsallah, this year we try our best to find
this year Qadr night. For more information we can see Surah:
Qadr Surah Dukhan: 3-4
Bhukhari Muslim
Ibn Majah an-Nasa`i
Tirmidhee Abu Dawood"
"Ramadan Lessons #22
What is Eid should be Eid is one of the happiest days for Muslims. When we win the game and get rewarded, we
are filled with happiness and joy. It's just what we were all waiting for. This is also the reward day for our fasting. Right now we should ask ourselves, have we
done our fasting properly to get the rewards from Allah? If we haven’t, we don't have to be helpless. Because right now there are still just a few
more days left before eid. We should try our best during the remaining
days of Ramadan. There are two groups of people when returning
from Eid prayer. One group are the losers and the disappointers. And another group are the people has been
rewarded and is grateful. Allah (T) will say to them, “ Go, you have
been forgiven. You make me happy and now I will make you
happy.” So we should try to be like the second group
of people, because then we will be successful, InshaAllah. Before going to Eid prayer we should give
our Zakaat ul Fitr to the poor people so that we can purify our fasting. When we are wearing our best outfits for Eid
we are recognizing the kindness of Allah (T). It also involves beautification because Allah
(T) is beautiful and he loves that which is beautiful. InshaAllah we should enjoy our day and have
lots of fun but one mistake we usually do is that during Eid day, we forget to pray
our prayer on time. But no matter what, we should not miss our
prayer time. Eid is the day of our happiness, so during
this day we should make other people happy, and by doing that you’ll see InshaAllah
you’ll be happy meaning that Allah (swt) will happy as well. When we are happy during the day of our Eid
it means that we will InshaAllah have a really happy eid. Let’s see one story on how we can really
became happy. A long time ago, one year Makkah had a very
bad drought. And because of the drought there was a food
shortage everywhere. There were many hungry people who went to
bed with an empty stomach. At that time Umar (pbuh) a Calipha, which
is like a king or president. He decided to give free food to all of the
poor people. Everybody was very happy to him. And during the night time he used to go out
in secret to different streets and neighborhoods so he could try to know the people real condition
of their struggles. He saw that everybody was sleep. He felt good that people were not awake because
of their hunger. After a long walk he saw a little fire was
lit, since at that time they didn’t have lights, in front of a small poor house. He went to that house and heard some children
were crying, and their mom was cooking something. Umar (pbuh) knocked on the door and asked
the mom, why they were crying. She did not recognize the Calipha. He said, her children were hungry for three
days because her husband died and they did not have any income to buy food. Umar (pbuh) asked her, what was he cooking? She told him that it was just water and stones
in the pot. She did this so her kids would stop crying
and, cool down hoping that their food would be ready after sometime, since they didn’t
know their mom wasn’t actually making anything and was only pretending to so they would stop
crying. In the meantime they would be tired and fall
sleep. After hearing that, Umar (pbuh) became very
sad and felt guilty. He thought as a Calipha he did not distribute
food to the poor properly. He immediately went to the store and filled
a bag with food. As he started to carry the bag, one of his
workers was surprised to see that. He requested Umar (pbuh) to give that bag
to him to carry. Umar (pbuh) said he felt guilty, so he himself
should carry that bag to that family. He gave the food to the mom and helped her
cook food. When the food was ready, the children and
the mother ate their food and had a full stomach. They were very satisfied and smiled with happiness. Umar (pbuh) also felt very happy as if though
it was like eid. He asked the mom, why she did not go to the
Calipha and asked for help. The mom replied, she was poor but she wasn’t
a bagger. And that was the Calipha's duty, to check
if anybody was starving in his kingdom. Umar (pbuh) realized his mistake and requested
to forgive him. The mom was surprised to know that it was
Calipha himself who had brought the food for them. The mom was very happy to see the Calipha
and to her it also felt like the happiness of Eid. Same as Umar (pbuh), this is would be our
eid, the happiness, to bring smile on others. It is our duty as a Muslim to bring smile
on the people of Syria, Rohinga, Palestine, Kashmir and every other Muslims who had lost
their smile. As a Muslim, is it not our duty to bring peace
and smile in this world? Yes, as a Muslim we should bring peace and
smile to everybody, it doesn’t matter if they are Muslims or Non-Muslims. This  is our deen, our iman, our religion and our
promise  to Eid."

 from the well, and how he became a very important 
person in Egypt! That’s great! Please tell me 
the story Baba! In the last episode, we saw how Yusuf (as) 
was dumped in a well by his brothers, and how the travelers saved him Bismillah! Prophet Yusuf (as):
 From the well to the palace! As they saved the prophet, they chained him and took
 him to Egypt. They travelled for many days and nights
 through the desert. And after many days of travel, they finally arrived in Egypt The travelers went to the market, 
and put the prophet for auction “Who will buy this handsome young boy?” 
they shouted The news spread fast, and people gathered in hundreds to watch
 the unusually handsome young boy. After an auction, the Aziz,
chief minister of Egypt bought the young prophet for a
 few silver coins. When they reached the palace, the prophet was pleasantly surprised when the chief minister ordered his 
men to remove his chains. Aziz then told the prophet to
 never betray his trust and also promised him that he
never be ill-treated. “Make his stay comfortable here” 
Aziz said to his wife. “He is such an intelligent
 young man” Yusuf (as) felt at ease at last. He knew that he had a shelter, and he was well taken care of. He thanked Allah (swt) over and 
over again. It was not very long ago that he was
 cast into a deep dark well, with no hope of coming out alive. Then he was enslaved,
 and he was chained. But now, he could enjoy all the
 luxuries of the palace, and he had plenty of food to 
eat as well.  However his heart ached with longing for his parents and his
 little brother Benyamin. Yusuf (as) was made the personal attendant
 of the chief minister’s wife. He was obedient and 
ever-obliging. With his pleasant manners and
 charming behavior, he won everybody’s heart. Soon, Yusuf’s (as) beauty became 
the talk of the town. People referred to him as the most
attractive man that they had ever seen!. His face carried immaculate beauty,  it was the purity of his soul reflecting
 on his face! As he grew older, he gained wisdom and knowledge. He soon became a good speaker, always captivating the audience. His master realized that Yusuf(as)
 was the most honest, straightforward and noble person
 he had met in his life. And after sometime, he was put
 in charge of the household, and the chief minister treated
 him like his son! The wife of the chief minister Zulaikha, admired Yusuf (as) very much. As she watched him and listened
 to him speak, her passion for the prophet
 increased by the day The chief minister's wife could not resist
 her temptations anymore, and it caused her sleepless nights. She was madly in love with the prophet! Zulaikha could not control her 
passion any longer. One day when the prophet was alone
 with her in the bedroom, she tried to kiss him! But Yusuf (as) denied, as he was an upright worshipper
 of Allah (swt). He then walked away from her. The prophet’s refusal heightened 
the passion of Zulaikha As he was moving towards the door, she ran after him and she
 caught hold of his shirt! While she was tugging, she tore his shirt, and she held the
 torn piece in her hand! Then the door opened suddenly, and there stood her husband and 
another relative of hers Seeing her husband, the crooked woman
 immediately changed her tone. “Your man tried to grab me” she said showing him the 
torn piece of cloth  “you must put him in prison now” She was now trying to accuse the prophet 
of molesting her! But the prophet denied it “It was she who tried to grab me”
 he said. Aziz and her relative examined the shirt to
 find out who was saying the truth. They found that the it was
 torn at the back. The chief minister then looked 
at his wife and said “If he was the one to attack you, the shirt whould have been
 torn in the front. But Yusuf’s shirt is torn
 in the back, which means you are lying. He said angrily When Aziz realized that his wife 
had been lying, he apologized to the prophet for his 
wife’s indecent behavior. He then asked his wife to beg forgiveness
 from the prophet! The news of the incident spread in the
 town like a wildfire! “Look at her” 
some of them said “she tried to seduce her slave!” Others laughed at her behaviour Zulaikha was upset with people
 gossiping about her. She honestly believed that it was not
 easy for any woman to resist a man as handsome
 as Yusuf (as). To prove her helplessness, she planned to subject the women to the
 same temptation that she had faced She decided to invite all the women in her
 circle for a banquet at her palace! The banquet was reserved 
exclusively for women. Everyone who were invited turned up
 for the event, and most of them secretly hoped that they
 would get a chance to see Yusuf (as)!. Then suddenly Zulaikha decided to 
open the topic. “Listen everyone” she spoke
 to the guests, “I have heard of those who say that
 I am in love with my slave” At once everybody stopped what
 they were doing, and fixed their gaze on the 
Chief minister's wife. “I admit that he is a charming fellow. I do not deny that I love him, as I have loved him 
for a long time” Everyone at the banquet were stunned
 to hear this confession, coming from none other than the wife 
of the chief minister! In the meantime,  Zulaikha asked her servants to distribute
 the fruits among the guests. After finishing the dinner, the guests began cutting their fruit It was at this moment that Zulaikha summoned Yusuf (as) to make
 an appearance. He entered the hall gracefully
 with his gaze lowered. When Zulaikha called him by name,
 he raised his head. The guests were astonished and dumbfounded
 when they saw the face of Yusuf (as). His face was shining with
 angelic beauty.  It reflected pure innocence, so much so that one could feel the peace 
in the depth of his soul! They exclaimed in astonishment while they 
were cutting the fruit. As all of their eyes were on the prophet, the women began to cut their palms absent
 mindedly without feeling any pain! One of the ladies gasped “This is not a mortal being”, another stammered 
“ He is a noble angel!” All their attention were
 on the prophet, and no one noticed the blood flowing
 from their hands Then Zulaikha stood up. “Look at your hands”
 she said to them When the women looked at their hands, they realized that they were bleeding, and they wrapped their towel
 on top of it. “Its because of him that I have
 been blamed” she said. “I do not deny that I tried to 
seduce him”. “You too would have been
 enchanted by him, and see what happened to
 your hands!” “If he refuses to obey my order again, then he shall be put in prison” 
she said to everyone “Oh Lord” the prophet calmly replied. “I would rather go to the prison,
than committing a sin” The prophet then quietly left the room, 
with his gaze lowered. That night, Zulaikha convinced
 her husband  that the only way to save her honor was by
 imprisoning the prophet. The chief minister loved the
 prophet like a son, and he knew that he was innocent. He had never met another man who
 was so loyal to him. It was with a heavy heart that Aziz ordered Yusuf (as) to be 
arrested and imprisoned. It was not an easy decision for him to put
 an innocent man behind the bars. However he was left with no choice. That day, the prophet was chained and
 put inside a prison. And this is where he had to 
face his third test! The third test? Yes Amir, I will tell you about
 that tomorrow! Mashallah, that was such
 a great story!! Alright.. Now are you ready 
for the questions? Yes! Now tell me, who bought the 
Prophet at the auction? It was the chief minister!! What was his name? His name was..
His name was.. Aziz! That’s correct my son! Now tell me why did the Prophet 
walk away from Zuleikha,  the wife of the chief minister? She was trying to kiss the prophet,
 but the Prophet refused. He then walked away Why was the Prophet sent to jail, even though the Chief minister knew that 
he was not guilty? Zuleikha, the wife of Aziz proved that no woman can resist their
 temptations when the Prophet was around. She proved her case, and Aziz was left with
 no choice other than to imprison him Masha Allah! That was very good. I will tell you the remaining
 story tomorrow. Good night Amir"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam Baba! So are you ready for
 today's story? Yes! Alright, now listen carefully Bismillah! In the last episode, we saw how
Yusuf (as) was put in prison in spite of being innocent. It was in the prison that the prophet had
 to face his third test! It was during this period
 that Allah (swt) blessed him with an
 extraordinary gift! The prophet was blessed with the
 ability to interpret dreams! The people in the prison knew that
Yusuf (as) was a noble young man  with great knowledge and
 a merciful heart. They loved and respected him At about the same time, two other men landed
in the prison. One was the cupbearer
 of the king, and the other was the
 king's cook. That night, both the new inmates
 had a strange dream! When they woke up, they were confused as they could not
understand the meaning of the dream The next day, when they
saw the prophet, they realized that he was
 not a common criminal. They approached him, and told
 him about their dream. “I had a very strange dream” I saw that I was standing in a place
 with bread on my head. There were two birds eating the bread
on top of my head! On hearing this, the prophet first called them
 to Allah (swt). He told them the meaning
of his dream. The dream meant that the cook was going
to be crucified until he died. Then the prophet asked the cupbearer
 to tell him about his dream “I saw that I was standing
 inside the palace” said the cupbearer  “and I was serving wine
to the king!” The prophet prayed for some time and he said that the cupbearer will be
 soon let free, and that he will return to the
 service of the king The prophet then asked the cupbearer
 to talk to the king about him, and tell him that there was a
wronged soul  named Yusuf in the prison. What the prophet predicted
soon happened, and the cook was crucified just like the prophet foretold. The cupbearer returned to the
palace as well But as soon as he returned
to service, Shaytan made him forget
 about the prophet. And therefore, Yusuf (as) remained in prison for a
few more years. After a few years, one night the king was sleeping
 in his palace. The king had a strange dream
that night, and in his dream he saw that he was standing at the
 banks of river Nile. He saw that the water was receding,
revealing the bare mud. He saw the fish skipping and jumping
 without water. Then he saw seven fat cows emerging
 from the water,  followed by seven lean cows The lean cows then began
 swallowing the fat cows! The king was terrified
 seeing this! He then saw seven ears of green corn
 growing by the riverbank. Suddenly they disappeared and in its place grew seven 
dry ears of corn!! The king woke up terrified
 from his dream. He was shocked and depressed, as he could not understand the 
meaning of his dream The next day, he called his ministers,
 priests and advisors,  and told them about his dream. The sorcerers said “This is a very confusing dream! How can any of that happen?” The priests said, “Perhaps you had a heavy dinner!” “May be you slept without
 a blanket!” said the chief minister All of them said that it was 
only a nightmare, and there was nothing
 to worry about! The news reached 
the cupbearer. He recollected the dream he had 
while he was in prison, and suddenly he remembered 
Yusuf (as). He ran to the king to tell him
 about the prophet. “He had asked me to tell you
 about his innocence” He said to the king,
 “but I forgot” When he explained how Yusuf (as) had interpreted his dream
 while in prison, King sent him to meet
 the prophet. The cupbearer met the prophet and told
 him about the King’s dream The prophet prayed to Allah(swt) and then 
explained the meaning of the dream. “There will be seven years of rich 
harvest in the kingdom” He said. “If the land is cultivated properly, there will be a good harvest, and people will have more
 than enough food” “This will be followed by seven years of 
drought in the kingdom. People will not have enough to eat, and there will be scarcity of
 food all over Egypt.” When the cupbearer told the king 
about the interpretation, the King was fascinated! He commanded that 
Yusuf (as) be set free, and presented before
 him at once! When the king's envoy arrived at the 
prison to set him free, the prophet refused to
 leave the prison. “I will not leave the prison  until my innocence is proven” 
he told them The envoy returned to the king “Where is Yusuf?” 
asked the king. “Did I not command you
 to fetch him?” “He refused to leave until his innocence
 is established” they replied The king realized that the prophet was
 unfairly put in prison, so he immediately ordered an enquiry. Zulaikha, wife of the chief minister was 
brought into his court, and so were the wives of the 
other ministers  who had attended the
 lavish banquet. “What is the story of Yusuf?” The king asked them. “Is it true that he tried to molest
 the chief minister’s wife?” “He didn’t do anything” 
said one woman “He did her no harm”
 said another “He is innocent as the angels”
 said another. Everyone’s attention now 
turned to Zulaikha. She now wore a wrinkled face. She was overwhelmed with sorrow 
while the prophet was in prison. “I tempted him, 
but he refused” she boldly confessed. “So he is innocent as he says”
 said the king. When the prophet came
 to the palace, the King was stunned by this
 handsome young man. He spoke to the prophet for a while, 
to test his knowledge. The replies of the prophet
 stunned the king  and he was convinced that he was 
very intelligent indeed! Then the conversation
 turned to the dream. The prophet advised the king to start 
planning for years of famine ahead. He informed the king that the famine
 would not only affect Egypt, but all other neighboring
 countries as well. The king then appointed the prophet as the
 controller of granaries. It was his responsibility to guard
 the nations harvest and make plans for the 
anticipated famine. The wheels of time had 
turned by now. The prophet, who was in prison
 till a few months ago, had now become one of the senior
 most officials in Egypt. During the seven good years
 that followed, the prophet had full control 
over the cultivation., harvesting and storage of crops. He did his duties faithfully, and he carefully saved the grains 
for the harsh years ahead. What happened next? I will tell you the remaining 
story tomorrow! Masha Allah! That was such a wonderful story!! Baba, did the prophet ever 
see his father again? You will have to wait till tomorrow 
to know that! Ok.. So are you ready for the questions? Yes!! Alright, now tell me what were the 
occupation of the two men who landed in prison, 
along with the prophet? One was a cook, and the other was..
 A cupbearer! That’s correct Now tell me about the king's dream The king dreamt that he was standing
 at the banks of river Nile. While he was standing there, he saw seven fat cows coming 
out of the water, and then seven lean 
cows came out. The lean cows then swallowed
 the fat cows! Mashallah! And what
 about the rest? Then the king saw seven green ears
 of corn growing by the river. These green ears disappeared,
 and in its place,  there was seven dry ears of corn And what did the dream mean? The dream meant that the country 
was going to receive  a rich harvest for the 
next seven years. And then, there was going to be
 seven long years of drought. That’s very good! Why did the prophet refuse to come
 out of the prison? The prophet wanted his innocence
 to be proved, that’s why he stayed in the prison That’s right again! And how did the king prove his innocence? The king called the wife of chief minister
 along with other women, and questioned them. But this time, everyone
 said the truth, and the prophet was
 proved innocent. That’s correct my son.  And now, for the last question. What position did the king 
offer the prophet? The prophet was made the
 controller of granaries! Masha Allah! You gave all the right answers my son. Now that’s all for today, I will tell you the remaining
 story tomorrow. Good night Good night Baba!"
"Assalamu Alaikum Walaikum Assalam Uncle, which story are you
going to tell me today?  Inshallah, I will tell you
the story of Imam ali Ibn Talib Please tell his story uncle Alright, Now listen carefully! The Story of Ali bin Talib
(Rali Allahu Anhu) Born to Abu Talib and Fatimah bint Asad, Ali was the only child believed
to have been born in the sacred sanctuary of the Kaaba, in Mecca,
the holiest place in Islam. Ali was the first young
male who accepted Islam. After migrating to Medina, he married Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu
alaihi wasallam)’s daughter Fatimah. Ali took part in the early caravan
raids from Mecca and later in almost all the battles fought
 by the nascent Muslim community. He was appointed caliph by the
 Prophets companions in 656 after Caliph Uthman ibn
Affan was assassinated. Now let us watch and learn the amazing
story of the first Imam in Islam.  Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) was
born in a very unique circumstance. He was born on the Friday, 13th of Rajab, 23 years before the first Hijra. Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) was almost 30 years old when Ali was born. Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) was
born inside the Holy Kaaba. His mother Fatima bint Asad was praying
 outside the Kaaba,  when suddenly she felt
intense pain of childbirth. She knelt to pray, and when she raised her head
 from prostration, the wall of the Holy Kaaba split as if to admit her inside!. Once she was inside, the walls of the
Kaaba returned to the normal position. Had it not been the will of Allah
 (Subhanahu wa ta'ala,) such a thing would have never happened. This crack is still present till this
date on the walls of Holy Kaaba. Many people saw this, including the uncle of Prophet-  Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib. They were outside the Kaaba when
the whole incident took place. They ran around and told people
about what had happened. The news spread like wildfire
 all over Makkah.  The keys of the Holy Kaaba
were brought to unlock the door,  but all efforts ended in failure. On the fourth day,
there was a miracle. The people who had gathered
 around Holy Kaaba  saw that the locks of the door
 breaking down on its own! To their surprise, they saw
 Fatima bint Asad walking out of the building holding a
 newborn baby in her arms! From a very young age, it was the Prophet
who fed him and took care of him. Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi
 wasallam) fondled him in his lap. He made Ali sleep by his side. The little one enjoyed the warmth
of the Holy Prophet and inhaled the holy fragrance
 of his breath. Amirul Momineen,
 Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (Rali Allahu Anhu) was born three years before the marriage of Prophet
 Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) with Hazrat Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha). He lived along with his parents and
 brothers for six years, before the Prophet adopted him. Ali moved to the Prophet’s house because of the financial crisis
 his parent were facing. Ever since he was six years old, the young boy lived with the Prophet. It was at the Prophet’s house that
he spent his teen and adolescence. He witnessed all the happenings
in the Prophet’s life. Ali’s education was not a normal
one, like other children. He followed the Prophet like His shadow
everywhere and learned a lot from him. He followed the Prophet even during
the times of exclusive privacy. He witnessed the mental and spiritual
developments of the Prophet  on top of Hira mountain. The Prophet used to stay on
the mountain for 3 or 4 days. Sometimes Ali carried his
food to the mountain. When Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)  and His wife first accepted Islam, Ali was the third person to follow Islam. Ali started acting as the Prophet’s
bodyguard even when he was just a boy. Young men from Quraish clan used
to throw stones at the Prophet. Ali could not bear this sight, and
he would attack the Quraishi men. He fought against those who were much
older than him, and he was often injured. After some days, he was
 nicknamed as Qaazim, which meant the breaker of the thrower. Nobody dared to throw anything at
the Prophet when Ali was with him. It was the night of Hijra. Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu
alaihi wasallam) informed Ali about his dangerous plan of
migrating to Medina. He asked Ali if he would sleep in his bed
in place of him to confuse the attackers. It was a dangerous situation. The walls of Prophet’s house was
hardly seven feet high and attackers could easily jump in. But when the Prophet asked him if he
 was willing to accept this danger,  Ali replied with another question. “If I sleep in your place, in your
bed, will your life be saved? The Prophet replied yes. Ali then thanked
 Allah (Subhanahu wa ta'ala,) and slept in the bed of Holy Prophet, covering himself with Prophet’s blanket
without any hesitation. It was because of Ali that Prophet was
 able to leave the house unnoticed. He left for Medina,
and by the time attackers realized this,Prophet
was far away from Makkah The Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi
 wasallam) had handed him the money which people of Makkah had entrusted. After three days of Prophet's departure,  Ali returned the money to their
respective owners He then set out to leave Makkah for
 Medinah along with the rest of his family. Even though the enemies tried to stop him,  he drove the infidels away and safely
arrived in Medina. The Prophet was waiting for
 him outside the city. When he saw Ali, he was overjoyed
 and embraced him. He welcomed Ali and the rest
of his family to Medinah. The Prophet created a bond of
brotherhood between Muslims. He declared that Ali
was his brother. Once the family settled in the newly
adopted city of Medina, their first task was to complete the mosque
 around which their houses were built. The Prophet, Ali and other Muslims in
Medina helped in building the mosque. Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu)was married
 to Hazrat Fatima (Rali Allahu Anha), the daughter of Prophet
Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). It was a very happy marriage. Their characters blended so well that they never quarrelled and
 complained of one another. They led a happy
and conded life. Each one of them was rich in
their own rights. Fatima was the only heir to the
 richest woman of Arabia, and she had inherited many orchards
and gardens in Makkah and Medinah. She was also the daughter of the
most respected person in Makkah. Ali had become the
marshal as well. Yet they gave away all that they owned
to the poor and the orphans in the town. They had to starve
themselves often. Their only luxury in life was the
prayers and the company of each other. They were given a girl to help them
in household chores, Bibi Fizza. But the Prophet had made
 arrangements in such a way that the girl only had to attend her
duties every alternate day. Bibi Fizza was not allowed to
 attend to her duties even when Fatima was ill during off day. But Ali would do the household
chores on such days  and would attend to her needs. He grinded the oats, lighted the oven, prepared bread and
  looked after the children. The battles of Badr, Ohud, Khadaq and
Khyber were fought in the defense of Islam and won by the hands of
Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu). along with other Sahabahs. He was not only the standard bearer
of the flag in those battles,  but always led the forces of
 Islam and came victorious. Even though he was the strongest
 and the bravest man in town, he used to go shopping and carry home
 the goods himself. When people saw him, they used to hurry
to him to help carry the burden. But he would deny them all and tell them “It is more fitting for a family head  carry his own burden” Such was his humilility that Hazrat Salman al Farsi (Rali
Allahu Anhu) once saw him and said. “What a household! The daughter of the Holy Prophet and his wife is leading the life
of a poor labourer. If they had saved one tenth of what
they are distributing daily, they would have led a life of
 ease and comfort” Fatima gave birth to four children. She died during the
 birth of her fifth child. Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) never
married any other woman while his wife Fatima was alive. After her death he married Yamamah, and after her death another
woman named Hanafia. Ali was also known for
his generosity. Like the Prophet, he too liked to lead a
simple life, and he gave away all the rest. One day, he was returning home with a
string of camels, fully laden with goods. On the way, a beggar asked
Ali for a piece of bread. Ali ordered his beloved servant Qambar
to give some bread to the beggar. Qambar started searching
for the bread. He had forgotten in where
he had packed the bread. After a few moments, Ali asked
Qambar why there was a delay. Qambar replied that he was
still searching for the bread. Amir al Miminin Hazrat Ali
 (Rali Allahu Anhu) said “Give the beggar the camel which
carries the bread.” Qambar was now running
between the camels After a while Ali
inquired about the delay. Qambar replied “I am searching for
the camel carrying the food.” Ali was getting angry. He then ordered Qambar to give
the whole caravan to the beggar. Qambar hurriedly jumped off from the camel and handed the reins of
caravan to the fortunate beggar. Ali was surprised at how quickly
Qambar had handed over the caravan. So he asked him why he handed
over the caravan in such a haste? Qambar replied “Master, you are in such a mood that on
account of a small delay, you gave away the whole caravan. I was afraid that if there was some
delay in handing over the caravan, you might have given me away also
with the caravan. You will get a thousand slaves like me, but where will I get a master like you? There are many other stories
that showed his generosity. On another day, Ali went to the
market with his servant Qambar. He bought two shirts from the market,  one which was really nice and expensive, and the other which was not as good. When they returned home,
 he gave the good shirt to Qambar and kept the poor one for himself. Qambar asked his master to keep
 the good one for himself as he was the leader of the Muslims. He said that he could wear the
poor one as he was just a servant. Ali answered that Qambar should
wear the nicer shirt because he was younger
and it would suit him better. But more importantly, Ali told him that he
 was a guide for Muslims and he had to set a good example
 before them by leading a simple life. One day, two men met outside the city. One was a Muslim, and the other
belonged to some other religion. The Muslim man was going to Kufa, the capital and the center
of Islamic Government. Other gentleman was headed to
 another place nearby Since a part of their journey
was through a common route, they decided to travel together. On the way they talked about
various topics of mutual interest. They finally arrived at the point
where their paths separated. The Muslim started walking along
with his Non Muslim companion. The man was surprised and asked the Muslim “Didn’t you say you were going to Kufa?” “Yes” said the Muslim “Then why are you
coming this way?. The other road
takes you to Kufa” “I know.  I want to walk a few
steps with you to see you off. As our Prophet has said “Whenever two persons travel together
 on the same path,  they establish reciprocal right upon
each other”. ” Now you have got a right upon me and for the sake of that right  I wish to walk a few steps with you. And then I shall return
to my own route.” The Non muslim was really impressed “I now know why your religion is
spreading so fast in this world. It is because of such noble practices your
religion preach in such a perfect way! It is all because your Prophet
 Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)” The surprise and admiration
of this non-Muslim friend reached its peak when he learned
that his Muslim friend was Amir Al Muminin, Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu),
the Caliph of that time. This man soon embraced Islam and was counted as one of the trusted
companion of Hazrat Ali(Rali Allahu Anhu) Even after becoming the caliph, Hazrat Ali often visited the markets and
 other public places all alone by himself. He walked around with no escort,
servants or any other companion. He was always concerned
about the poor, the needy and orphan
children in the society. He helped them as
often as he could. One day as usual, he had finished his
 noon prayers in the mosque  and was passing through the market. Suddenly, he saw a little girl sitting
in a corner and weeping. Hazrat Ali approached her as
asked her why she was crying. She looked at the stranger and told him that she worked as a
servant in a nearby house. Her master had given her some
money to buy some dates. She bought the dates from this trader
 in the opposite street,  and took them to her master. But her master didn’t like the dates and asked her to return it to the trader. But now the trader was
refusing to take it back. This was the reason
why she was crying. She was afraid that her
master would beat her. Hazrat Ali consoled her and took her to
the shop where she bought the dates from He met the trader and told him “this little girl is working as a servant  and she has no authority of her own. Take back the dates, and
the money she paid you” The trader was new in Kufa and he didn’t
recognise the man standing before him. “Who are you to give me orders? I will not take back the
 goods which are sold. Go away, and don’t waste my time”  He said rudely. A passerby overheard this
and ran to the trader. When the trader realized that he had
 disrespected the caliph of Kufa,  his face went pale! He apologised for his mistake, and
returned the little girl’s money. Then turning to Hazrat Ali, he
cried “O’ Ameer al Momineen! Please forgive me!” “I shall only be pleased with you when
 you pay attention to the morals  taught in Islam” When the owner of the slave girl
heard about this news, he too came running to Hazrat Ali. He apologized for the trouble
caused by his slave girl But the Caliph was really very
 angry at the master.  “How can you not forgive the
mistake of a little girl? You have no right to expect mercy
and forgiveness from the Lord? You people call yourself Muslims, yet have learned nothing from Islam.” The trader and the master
realized their mistakes and worked hard to become good
 muslims from that day. It was the hottest day of summer A woman was carrying water on her
back, walking towards her house. She was thinking of her children who were
waiting for her to drink some water. They were thirsty  and were very hungry too. But this scorching sun was
not making her job easy. She was very tired,  but she slowly and steadily kept walking. When they reached her house, he placed the water at their
doorstep and asked “Isn't there any man in this
house to help you? Why are you staying alone?” “My husband was a
soldier” she said. “He fought for our Caliph, and he
was killed last year in a war”. Hazrat Ali was left
with no words to say. He bowed his head and took
leave without uttering a word Ali sleeping in his bed But the thought of this woman
 and her children didn’t let Hazrat Ali sleep
 the whole night. He felt guilty for letting
the woman’s husband die. The next day morning, he took a basket and
filled it up with flour, dates and meat. He then went straight
to the woman’s house. He knocked at the door and
 when the woman opened,  she recognised him from the day before and asked why he was there “I have brought some food
for the children” he said The woman was so happy 
as no one had offered her any help since her husband died.  She cried and said “May Allah bless you and judge
between you and Ali”. She hated Ali so much for
sending her husband to war. She opened the door and
asked him to come inside. “I want to offer you my help in any
way I can. What can I do for you? Shall I knead the flour
for you” he asked her. “Very well. I can cook better than you, but if you are eager to help,
 then please look after the children. Hazrat Ali looked after the
children and played with them. After sometime he took the meat
from the basket and grilled them. Then he started feeding the
children with his own hands. He kept saying  “My son,  forgive Ali if he has failed
in his duty towards you” everytime he fed the children. When the flour got ready, the woman
asked him to put fire in the oven. He agreed and made the fire. But when the flames rose up,  he brought his face near the fire and said “Taste the heat of the fire. That is the punishment for those who ignore
 their duties towards orphans and widows” Such was his regret! It was then that a neighbour walked into
the house, and she recognised Hazrat Ali. When she realized that it was the
Caliph indeed, she cried to the woman “Don’t you recognize the
man who is helping you? He is Amir al-Muminin,
Imam Ali bin Abu Talib!” The widow was shocked. She came forward and cried in shame “Shame on me.
 Please forgive me” Then Hazrat Ali replied “No, I beg your pardon because I
failed in my duty towards you.” From that day, the needs of the widow
and their sons were taken care of. Hazrat Ali always had a soft corner towards
 widows, orphans and other needy people. He believed that the Muslim society played
a major role in taking care of them. It is what Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) had taught him Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) always
 dressed poorly and ate simple food. Even beggars in Kufa ate
better food than the Caliph. He did so because he wanted to spend all that he could on the poor 
and needy in the city. Once he was having his
breakfast when he had a guest. The guest saw that Hazrat Ali had a cup of
water and some barley bread in front of him He could see that the bread
 did not have any oil or butter and it was very hard and stale. Hazrat Ali was trying very hard
to break the bread into pieces. Seeing this, the guest asked
Ali’s servant Bibi Fizza “Fizza, Don’t you have
any pity on your master? Why don’t you add some oil in the bread so
that your master can have softer bread? “Why should I pity him when
he is so hard on himself” said Bibi Fizza. “He has given strict orders
to add nothing to his bread. He even asked us not to separate the chaff  and husks from the flour. Even though we are servants,
 we have much better food than him” Hearing this guest said to Hazrat Ali,  “O Master, have pity on yourself. Look at your age and your responsibilities, and is this what you are eating?” “O friend” replied Hazrat Ali. You have no idea what Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) used to eat. He hardly had any food, and sometime he never ate a full stomach
 for three days in a stretch!. If the holy messenger
could suffer like that, then I too should avoid any
luxuries in my life.” The guest understood the nobility
 in Hazrat Ali’s actions, and he never repeated the
question ever again. Once after a hard days work,  Hazrat Imam Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu)  was sitting under a tree and
eating his barley bread. A beggar who was passing by
saw him and went to Ali. The beggar told him that he was hungry and
asked if he could offer him some food. Imam Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) readily
offered to share what he was eating and gave a piece of bread to the beggar. The old beggar thanked him,
and took the bread from him. But he found it very
hard to chew the bread! The beggar returned the bread and told
him that the bread was too hard for him. Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) then asked
the beggar to go to Imam Hassan’s house,  and told him that he would get
good hot food there. The beggar thanked him and
left for Imam Hassan’s house. The beggar arrived at Imam
Hassan’s house as he was told He was surprised to find that a huge
 banquet was spread out, and many people eating food there. When Imam Hassan
(Rali Allahu Anhu) saw the beggar, he invited the beggar to join them. The beggar started
eating the food, but while he was doing it, he ate one mouthful and then keep one mouthful
 of food in a separate bowl. Imam Hassan (Rali Allahu Anhu) was
confused seeing this. So he asked the beggar  “Why are you putting food in the bowl?” “I met a good man today  who was
eating dry barley bread with salt. He was so kind that he told
me to come here for food. I want to give him some
food for his kindness” When Imam Hassan (Rali Allahu Anhu)
 heard this,  he smiled and said “That man is none other than
Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib. This is his house. Even though he could lead a luxurious life,
he chsose to lead the life of a poor. He is a true muslim. Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) liked
farming as well. He used to work very hard in the
fields for cultivating crops. He had just bought a plot of
barren land outside Medinah. He wanted to cultivate this land
and for this, he needed water. Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) decided to
dig a well to get the water. The land was barren and there
were no hopes of getting any water. He placed his hopes on Allah
(Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala) and started to dig. He worked very hard that day, and when it was evening he went home. He arrived at the field early morning
next day and started digging again. He continued this routine for many days, but there was no sign of any water. One day, Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) took his pickaxe and entered the well. He used all his strength
and worked very hard. Unfortunately there was
no sign of water yet. Exhausted, he came out of the
well, and took rest for a while. He entered the well again  started digging with all his might. Such was his vigour that his breathing could be heard
 by nearby people. In one last effort, he struck
a rock with all his strength. It was a miracle! The ground split open, and fresh
clear water came from below! Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) was happy
and he got out of the well. The water rose up, and it
was such a wonderful well. He looked at the well and realized that this well would soon turn the
surrounding dry desert to a lovely farm! Soon the people gathered around
to see the well. Everyone was surprised! “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib is really
a hard working man” someone said. “Allah(Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala) has been
 generous to him and because He is such a good man!”
 said another. Most of the people were happy, and they congratulated him for
 what he had done. But not everyone was so happy. “He and his descendants have become
 rich forever!”  said his haters. They were jealous that he had found
water in this dry desert. Now the value of land
would rise considerably. “Bring me a paper and pen”
said Hazrat Ali. When he got what he asked,
he sat down and wrote: “I am donating this well and the land surrounding it in charity, and its income should be used as follows: In helping the poor,  in helping the travellers,  in providing the means for the
 marriages of orphans, in providing medical care for the poor,  in doing good works
for the public benefit. I am donating the well to seek the 
pleasure of Allah (Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala).” Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) 
had such humility,  that even his haters started loving him. Mashallah, that was
such a great story! I’m glad you liked it my son. I will tell you another story tomorrow. Thanks!
Massalam Yousuf uncle May Allah bless you! Massalam Abu. Good bye! Good bye!"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! How was your day my son? It was very good Baba! How about yours? It was good too! Now are you ready for the story
of another Prophet today? Yes Baba! Good! Insha Allah! Today I will tell you
the story of Prophet Isa (as) Who was He Baba? The importance of Isa (as) is apparent
from the status assigned to Him. He was the last messenger and Prophet
before Prophet Muhammad (saaw). He was also the last
messenger of Bani Israel. Allah had bestowed a special favor on the
 family of Isa (as)  by mentioning his name 25 times!! His mother's name is
mentioned 31 times as well! Masha Allah!
That is amazing! Please tell me his story Baba! I’m so excited! Alright, now listen carefully Bismillah! The story of Prophet Isa (as) In the story of Prophet Zachariah (as), we saw how the Prophet became the
guardian of Maryam(as) Maryam (as) was the daughter
 of Prophet Imran (as). Zachariah took care of this little girl, and He built a separate room for
 her in the temple. As Maryam (as) grew up,  she spent her
time in devotion to Allah (swt). The Prophet visited her daily to see her
needs, and it continued for many years! The Prophet taught
and guided Her. Maryam (as) grew to be a devotee of
Allah(swt), glorifying Him day and night. One day, Maryam (as) was
praying in her room as usual. It was then that an angel appeared
before Her, in the form of a man! Maryam (as) was terrified, thinking
that this man was here to harm her! And she shouted “I seek refuge with Allah from
you, if you do fear Allah” Then the angel said “I am only a messenger
of your Lord to you. I was sent to give you a pious child,
who is pure from sins” She had calmed down by now, and She asked the angel “How can I have a son, when
no man has touched me?” “That is very easy for Allah. Allah will make Him a sign for the people, and an indication of the
power of Allah(swt)! The angel's visit made Her very tensed, which increased as days passed by. How could She give birth to a
child without having a husband? After a few months, she could not
bear the mental strain any longer. Burdened with a heavy
womb, she left the city not knowing where to go. Maryam (as) had not gone far, when she was suddenly overtaken
by the pains of childbirth! She sat down against the dry palm tree,  and it was here that she
 gave birth to a son! When Maryam (as) looked at her
new born baby, she was hurt. How could she bring him into
this world without a father? She exclaimed ""I wish I had died before
this happened, and just vanished” Suddenly, she heard the
voice of an angel! “Grieve not!”
the voice said! “Allah has placed a
small river under you, and shake the trunk of this tree, from which ripe dates will fall. Eat and drink, and regain the
 strength you have lost. What you see is the
power of Allah(swt)! Maryam (as) drank water from the river, and ate the ripe dates. For a while, She was comforted
by Allah’s miracle! After some time, she stood up and
decided to return to the city. However, Her fears also returned “What was she going to tell
the people?” she thought It was then that another
miracle happened. Her baby, born just a few
hours ago, started to speak! The baby said  “If you meet any person, just tell them that You have vowed
 to fast for Allah today, and that You will not
speak to anyone!” With this miracle, Maryam (as) felt
at ease, and walked toward the city. As She had expected, her arrival in the
city with a newborn baby in her arms, aroused curiosity of the people! “This is a terrible sin you have
committed” They scolded her But She kept her calm. She put her fingers on her lips, gesturing that she cant talk,
 and pointed to her child. The people were angry. “How can we speak
to a newborn baby?” But the people were surprised
when the child began to speak. The child spoke slowly and clearly “I am Allah’s servant. Allah has given me the book,
and made me a prophet. Allah has made me dutiful towards
she who gave birth to me. Peace unto me the day I was born, the day I die, and the day
 I shall be raised alive!” The people just stood there,
watching the child speak, in wonder! They realized that the child was
unique, and that it was Allah’s will. Of course, there were some who regarded
the baby’s speech as a strange trick. But at least Maryam (as) could now stay
in the city without being harassed. It is said the Yusuf, the carpenter was greatly surprised when
 he heard the story of Maryam (as). “Can a tree grow without
a seed?” He asked her. “Yes” She replied “The One which Allah created for the
first time, grew without a seed” Then he asked her again “Is it possible
to bear a child without a male partner?” “Yes”
 Maryam (as) replied. “Allah created
Adham, without a male or a female” As Isa(as) grew, his prophecy
skills began to increase too! He could tell his friends what they were
 going to eat for supper, and what they had hidden and where. When he was twelve years old, He
accompanied his mother to Jerusalem. When they arrived at the temple, Isa (as)
wandered into the temple leaving his mother The young prophet wandered into a room where people were listening to
 the lectures of priests. Even though the audience
were full of adults, the prophet was not
afraid to sit with them. After listening to them for some time, He stood up and started asking questions. The learned priests were disturbed
 by the questions he asked,  for they were unable to answer them. The priests tried to silence him but the Prophet ignored them, he continued to ask questions
and expressed his opinion Isa(as) got so involved in this exchange
that he completely forgot his mother. In the meantime, Maryam (as) went home, thinking that her son might have gone back,  with their relatives or friends. But as soon as she reached home, she realized that her son was not there! So she ran to the
city to find him! She searched for many hours,
and finally found her son, sitting among the learned
and debating with them! Maryam (as) got very angry with him,  as she was worried so much. But the young prophet calmed her saying
that he lost track of time while he was debating with the priests."
"Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! So excited to hear the
 remaining story? I was waiting for you Baba! Alright.. I will tell you the
 story now. Now listen carefully Bismillah! Prophet Yusuf (as) meets his
brother Benyamin! Prophet Yusuf (as) had now become the
 controller of the granaries in Egypt. During the seven good years, the prophet
had full control over the cultivation, harversting and storage of crops. The prophet saved enough grains
during the abundant years. And then, like the prophet
had predicted, drought followed, and famine spread throughout
the nation. The leaves turned yellow, and not even a single drop of rain
 fell from the sky. But nobody in Egypt died of hunger, for the prophet had saved more than
 enough grains for the harsh years. “You were right Yusuf” the king
 said to the prophet “Its only because of you that our
 people are not suffering” “All our neighbors are asking
 for our help, what should I tell them?
He asked “Allah(swt) saved us”
 the prophet replied. “We have plenty of grains with us. I think this is the time we should
 help our neighbours. We can give them the grains,
 at a small price. Many lives can be saved” “I agree with you”
the King said. He then ordered to distribute the
grains evenly to those in need. This famine affected Canaan as well. Prophet Yaqub (as) heard the news of
 grains being distributed in Egypt. He decided to send his sons to
Egypt to get the grains, all of them, except Benyamin The brothers travelled for many days
 and finally arrived in Egypt. Prophet Yusuf (as) heard about
 the ten brothers who had arrived from a distant land. When they arrived to collect the grains, the prophet immediately
recognized them! But the brothers didn’t! How could they? To them he no longer existed! They had thrown him in the
well many years ago! The prophet then met them and
 welcomed them warmly. After giving them the provisions, he asked where they had come from “We are elven brothers,
son of a noble prophet. We come from Caanan”
they replied “I count only ten here” the prophet asked them “Our youngest brother is at home, tending our father's needs. On hearing this, the prophet’s eyes
 filled up with tears! He longed to meet his father,
and his little brother. “Are you truthful people”
He asked them The brothers were confused. “What reasons do we have to lie
 to you?” they asked him “If what you say is the truth, then bring your youngest brother,
 and I’ll double your rations. But if you do not bring him to me,  then you better not try entering
Egypt again” He warned them The brothers agreed, and said that they
will need their father's permission. The prophet then asked his servant to
 place the bag of money they paid, secretly in one of the grain sacks. After many days of travel,
they reached Caanan. They greeted their father and said “We were denied some supplies because
 you didn’t let Benyamin come with us. The controller of granaries has promised
to give us extra provisions if you let him come with us. Please father,
 send him with us, and we shall take good care of him! But the old prophet said sadly “I will never let Benyamin travel with you. How can I trust you knowing
what you did with Yusuf? Later, when they opened the grain sack, they were surprised to find their
 money purse inside “Look father” they said. “The noble official has returned
 our money!” ”This is a proof that they
 will not harm our brother” But the Old Prophet refused again After a few months, when
they had no more grains, Prophet Yaqub (as) asked them
 to travel to Egypt. ""We cannot go there without Benyamin”
said one of the brothers They reminded him of the warning given
 by the Egyptian official. The old prophet finally agreed, but only after they took an oath
 to bring him back safely. “Allah(swt) is witness to your pledge” he reminded them before they left. The prophet blessed them as they
set off for Egypt, and prayed for their protection The brothers travelled for many days
 through the desert, and they took good care of
Benyamin as well! When they arrived in Egypt,  Yusuf (as) welcomed them heartily. He prepared a feast for them,  and made them seated in pairs. The prophet sat next to his beloved
 brother Benyamin. He noticed that Benyamin
 was weeping “Why are you crying”
 he asked his little brother “if my brother Yusuf had been here, I would have sat next to him”
Benyamin replied. That night, when the prophet and
Benyamin were alone in the room, the prophet asked his brother “Would you like to have me
as your brother?” But Benyamin respectfully answered that he regarded him as a
 wonderful person, but he could never take the
 place of his brother. On hearing this, the prophet
 broke down and said. “Benyamin! I am your
 brother who was lost!  Fate has brought us together
 after so many years! Benyamin exploded with joy
 when he heard this!! “Listen to me”
 said the prophet “This should remain a secret
 for the time being” Benyamin agreed, and he flung his
arms around the prophet. They cried and shed tears of Joy!! The next day, while the brothers were
loading the bags of grains, the prophet ordered one of his servants
to keep the golden measuring cup inside Benyamin’s saddlebag secretly. When the brothers were
 ready to set out, the soldiers came running to them “O brothers! Stop there!
You are thieves!” shouted the soldiers When the people around heard this, they gathered around the brothers. “What have you lost?” asked
the confused brothers “The King’s Golden Cup”
 said the soldier “We didn’t come here to steal”
 said another brother The prophet had instructed one of the
soldiers to ask the brothers, the following question “What punishment would
you give for a thief?” “According to our law,  whoever steals becomes a slave
 to the owner of the property” answered a brother “We shall apply your law instead
 of the Egyptian law, then"" said the soldiers. They started searching their
 bags one by one. When they reached Benyamin, they pulled out the King’s Cup
 from his bag! The brothers were stunned! They thought of their father,
 and the pledge they had taken. They began to beg the
 Prophet for mercy! “Yusuf! O Minister, take one of us
 instead” they pleaded I really want to know what
 happened to the prophet That I will tell you in the
 next episode!! What happened then? Don’t worry my son..
 Its getting very late, I will tell you the remaining story
 tomorrow for sure! Oh no.. Shall I ask you a few questions
 from the story? Of course, go ahead Baba! Alright.. Now tell me what
 happened to the Prophet  after he was released from jail Prophet Yusuf (as) became the controller
 of granaries in Egypt. What happened then? During the seven good years, the prophet
 had full control over the cultivation, harvesting and storage of crops. The prophet saved enough grains 
during the abundant years And then, like the prophet
 had predicted,  drought followed,and famine spread 
throughout the nation. Did anybody die in Egypt
 because of hunger? No.. nobody in Egypt died of hunger, for the prophet had saved more than 
enough grains for the harsh years. Masha Allah, that’s the right answer! Now tell me why did the
 brothers arrive in Egypt? The famine affected Canaan as well. Prophet Yaqub (as) heard the news of 
grains being distributed in Egypt. He sent his sons to Egypt
 to get the grains. That’s right again! Did the brothers really steal
 the King’s Golden cup? No.. They did not. The Prophet had instructed
 one of his men  to keep the cup inside Benyamin’s 
saddle bag. He did this to keep Benyamin
 at the palace Masha Allah! 
That’s very good my son! I will tell you the remaining
 story tomorrow! Good night my son Good night Baba!"
"Assalamu Alaikum Walaikum Assalam! You are early today!  I wanted to hear more
stories of Hazrat Imam Ali. Are there any more
stories of him? Of course, there are many more. Alright, Sit there. Inshallah, I will tell you some more stories
of Hazrat Imam Ali bin Abu Talib (Rali Allahu Anhu) Bismillahirrahmanirrahim! The Story of Hazrat Imam Ali bin
 Abu Talib (Rali Allahu Anhu) Even after becoming the caliph, Hazrat Ali often visited the markets and
 other public places all alone by himself. He walked around with no escort,
servants or any other companion. He was always concerned
about the poor, the needy and orphan
children in the society. He helped them as
often as he could. One day as usual, he had finished his
 noon prayers in the mosque  and was passing through the market. Suddenly, he saw a little girl sitting
in a corner and weeping. Hazrat Ali approached her as
asked her why she was crying. She looked at the stranger and told him that she worked as a
servant in a nearby house. Her master had given her some
money to buy some dates. She bought the dates from this trader
 in the opposite street,  and took them to her master. But her master didn’t like the dates asked her to return it to the trader. But now the trader was
refusing to take it back. This was the reason
why she was crying. She was afraid that her
master would beat her. Hazrat Ali consoled her and took her to
the shop where she bought the dates from He met the trader and told him “this little girl is working as a servant  and she has no authority of her own. Take back the dates, and
the money she paid you” The trader was new in Kufa and he didn’t
recognise the man standing before him. “Who are you to give me orders? I will not take back the
 goods which are sold. Go away, and don’t waste my time”  He said rudely. A passerby overheard this
and ran to the trader. When the trader realized that he had
 disrespected the caliph of Kufa,  his face went pale! He apologised for his mistake, and
returned the little girl’s money. Then turning to Hazrat Ali, he
cried “O’ Ameer al Momineen! Please forgive me!” “I shall only be pleased with you when
 you pay attention to the morals  taught in Islam” When the owner of the slave girl
heard about this news, he too came running to Hazrat Ali. He apologized for the trouble
caused by his slave girl But the Caliph was really very
 angry at the master.  “How can you not forgive the
mistake of a little girl? You have no right to expect mercy
and forgiveness from the Lord? You people call yourself Muslims, yet have learned nothing from Islam.” The trader and the master
realized their mistakes and worked hard to become good
 muslims from that day. It was the hottest day of summer A woman was carrying water on her
back, walking towards her house. She was thinking of her children who were
waiting for her to drink some water. They were thirsty  and were very hungry too. But this scorching sun was
not making her job easy. She was very tired,  but she slowly and steadily kept walking. When they reached her house, he placed the water at their
doorstep and asked “Isn't there any man in this
house to help you? Why are you staying alone?” “My husband was a
soldier” she said. “He fought for our Caliph, and he
was killed last year in a war”. Hazrat Ali was left
with no words to say. He bowed his head and took
leave without uttering a word Ali sleeping in his bed But the thought of this woman
 and her children didn’t let Hazrat Ali sleep
 the whole night. He felt guilty for letting
the woman’s husband die. The next day morning, he took a basket and
filled it up with flour, dates and meat. He then went straight
to the woman’s house. He knocked at the door and
 when the woman opened,  she recognised him from the day before and asked why he was there “I have brought some food
for the children” he said The woman was so happy as no one had offered
her any help since her husband died.  She cried and said “May Allah bless you and judge
between you and Ali”. She hated Ali so much for
sending her husband to war. She opened the door and
asked him to come inside. “I want to offer you my help in any
way I can. What can I do for you? Shall I knead the flour
for you” he asked her. “Very well. I can cook better than you, but if you are eager to help,
 then please look after the children. Hazrat Ali looked after the
children and played with them. After sometime he took the meat
from the basket and grilled them. Then he started feeding the
children with his own hands. He kept saying  “My son,  forgive Ali if he has failed
in his duty towards you” everytime he fed the children. When the flour got ready, the woman
asked him to put fire in the oven. He agreed and made the fire. But when the flames rose up,  he brought his face near the fire and said “Taste the heat of the fire. That is the punishment for those who ignore
 their duties towards orphans and widows” Such was his regret! It was then that a neighbour walked into
the house, and she recognised Hazrat Ali. When she realized that it was the
Caliph indeed, she cried to the woman “Don’t you recognize the
man who is helping you? He is Amir al-Muminin,
Imam Ali bin Abu Talib!” The widow was shocked. She came forward and cried in shame “Shame on me.
 Please forgive me” Then Hazrat Ali replied “No, I beg your pardon because I
failed in my duty towards you.” From that day, the needs of the widow
and their sons were taken care of. Hazrat Ali always had a soft corner towards
 widows, orphans and other needy people. He believed that the Muslim society played
a major role in taking care of them. It is what Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) had taught him Thats all Abu. Next time I will tell you another story. Thanks. Maasalam Yousuf uncle. Good bye. Good bye."
"Uncle it is nice to be here. I am sure that you have
a story to tell me. Yes, my dear. I have a story to
tell you today. It is about another companion of the Prophet  Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) Abdulla Ibn Umm-Maktum (Rali Allahu Anhu) Uncle, please go ahead. I am so excited to hear the story Sure. Story of Abdulla Ibn Umm-Maktum Abdullah Ibn Umm-Maktum (Rali Allahu Anhu) was the companion of Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). He was blind by birth. He was also known as
Amru Ibn Umm Maktoom, as well as Amru Ibn Qais. His mother’s name was Aatika and her surname was Umm Maktoom which meant Mother of the Blind. People called her that name because
she gave birth to a blind child. He was the cousin of the Prophet’s
first wife  Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha) Abdullah Ibn Umm-Maktum was among the first converts to Islam. He loved his religion  and would walk his way
to the Masjid five times a day to offer his
obligatory prayers. Once the prophet took him and Musab Ibn Umair
(Rali Allahu Anhu) to Medina. They were entrusted with the task of teaching Quran
to the inhabitants before the Hijra took place. Abdullah (Rali Allahu Anhu) and
 Bilal Ibn Rabah (Rali Allahu Anhu)  were chosen as muezzins in Medina by
 the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) The Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)  had to  leave Medina for
participating in battles, and he gave Abdullah (Rali Allahu Anhu) the responsibility of leading the prayers. Abdullah(Rali Allahu Anhu) witnessed the
rise of Islam in Makkah. He was amongst the
first to accept Islam. He suffered with his brothers, when the Muslims were persecuted Abdullah Ibn Umm Maktum(Rali Allahu Anhu) was very much devoted to the
Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). He was so keen to
memorize the Quran, that he would not miss any opportunity to achieve his heart’s desire. His sense of urgency and his insistence were sometimes  irritating to the Prophet
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) as well. Once the Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)  was in a meeting with a group
of Persian nobles  and he was trying to convince them
 to become Muslims. He was talking with them  and explaining them about Islam
and the Holy Quran. The Prophet wished that they would
 respond positively to him  and accept Islam or at least call off their
persecution of his companions. During those days, the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
and Sahabahs were experiencing a lot of trouble
 from the Persians. That’s why this meeting was so
 important to him, and He wanted no one to disturb him. When the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) was seriously engaged
 in the conversation, Abdullah (Rali Allahu Anhu) walked in and asked him to read a verse
 from the Quran. He said: ""O messenger of God, teach me from what God has
 taught you."" The Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) frowned and turned away from him. He then turned his
attention to the Persians, and continued with
their conversation. The Prophet knew that
 if they accepted Islam, they would bring greatness to the religion, and strengthen his mission. He did not want to be disturbed and was
earnestly trying to convince them. Once the Prophet had
finished speaking with them, he left left the room. But as soon as he left the room, he was suddenly blinded partially,  and his head began to throb violently. At this point a revelation came
from Allah to the Prophet. It was in relation to this incident that Allah revealed the 80th Surah Abasa, rebuking the Prophet
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)  and commanding him to give priority
and attention  to the concerns of the true
 believers of Islam, like Abdullah Ibn Umm Maktum
 (Rali Allahu Anhu). Do you want me to recite
Surah 80th  for you: Sure, uncle. ""He frowned and turned away when
the blind man approached him. Yet for all you knew, , ""O Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) he might perhaps have grown in purity or have been reminded of the Truth, and helped by this reminder Now as for him who believes
himself to be self-sufficient, to him you gave your
whole attention, although you are not accountable for
his failure to attain to purity. But as for him who came unto you full of eagerness and in awe of God, Him did you disregard. This is but a reminder and so, whoever is willing may remember Him in the
light of His revelations blest with dignity, lofty and pure, borne by the hands
of the messengers, noble and most virtuous."" These are the sixteen verses which were revealed to the noble Prophet
Muhammad(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) about Abdullah Ibn Umm Maktum
(Rali Allahu Anhu), sixteen verses that have continued to be
 recited from that time  till today and shall continue
 to be recited. From that day, the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)  used to honor Abdullah Ibn
 Umm Maktum (Rali Allahu Anhu) and give him the utmost respect. The Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) never ceased to be generous with Abdullah Ibn
Umm Maktum(Rali Allahu Anhu). He took care to ask him
about his affairs, to fulfill his needs and took him into
his council whenever he approached. The situation of the Muslims
was very tough those days. The Prophet and the companions  had to face the attack of the
enemies every other day. When the enemies intensified
their persecution, Allah gave them permission to emigrate. Abdullah and Musab Ibn Umayr
 (Rali Allahu Anhu) were the first of the Companions
 to reach Madinah. As soon as they reached Yathrib, Abdullah (Rali Allahu Anhu) and  Musab Ibn Umayr (Rali Allahu Anhu) began talking to the people, Read Quran to them and taught
them the religion of Allah. Soon after the battle of Badr, the Prophet(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)  received a revelation from God raising the status of the Mujahideen  and preferring them over the Qaideen, those who remain
inactive at home. This was in order to encourage the Mujahid even further and to help the qaid to
 give up their inactivity. This revelation affected
 Ibn Umm Maktum deeply. Being a blind man,  he was excluded from the battles and
 he stayed home mostly.. In spite of being
excused from battle, the soul of Abdullah Ibn
 Umm Maktum (Rali Allahu Anhu)  refused to be content with staying among
 those who remained at home, while there was a
battle going on. He decided to actively involve in all campaigns of the Prophet
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). He was so eager to join
in the battle field. One day, he fixed a role for
himself in the battle field. He then said: ""Give me the flag and place me
on a horse between the two rows. I will carry it for
you and protect it, for I am blind and
cannot run away."" What he implied here was that he would never run away
 because of fear and he will be loyal to the Prophet
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) until his last breath. In the fourteenth year
after the hijrah, Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu) led a battle
 against the Persians  and won the battle. He then wrote to his governors: ""Send anyone with a weapon or a horse or who can offer any form of help to me.” Crowds of Muslims from every direction
responded to Umar's call and travelled to Madinah. Among them were the blind Mujahid
Abdullah Ibn Umm Maktum. He had vowed to carry and protect
the rights of the Muslims  or be killed in the process. The forces met and engaged
in battle for three days. The fighting was among the most fierce  and bitter in the history of the
 Muslim conquests. On the third day, the Muslims achieved a mighty victory  as one of the greatest empires
 in the world collapsed and one of the most
secure thrones fell. The price of this clear victory
was hundreds of martyrs. Among them was Abdullah
Ibn Umm Maktum. He was found dead in the battlefield
still holding the flag in his arms. He was a true believer of Allah,  who feared nothing. He was a great inspiration to those
who were physically challenged, who thought that they could not
achieve anything in their life. So did you like the story of
Abdullah Ibn Umm Maktum (Rali Allahu Anhu)? Mashallah, that was great uncle Yousuf. I loved the story very much. He was a great man with great love
 towards the Prophet, the Holy Quran and the religion. Okay. It is time to go home. Common, let us walk home. [----Crickets chirping---]"
"Assalamu Alaikum Walaikum Assalam! How was your school today? It was good uncle. How was your work? It was fine Abu. So, have you finished your homework? Yes Uncle I had finish that as soon
 I reached the home. Very good Abu. So, are you ready for the story then? I'm uncle. The story of Khadhija (Rali Allahu Anha) One day,Khadija(Rali Allahu Anha) 
was talking to Her friend  ""I have never met such a good man. This is for the first time that I have
mad so much profits, and its all because of Him. I think I am very lucky to have
hired the nephew of Abu Talib”. Her friend agreed with Her “Yes, you are very lucky!” “I think you should marry Him. He is good man, and you are a widow. You like Him so much too!” It was then that Khadija
(Rali Allahu Anha) thought about this. “Yes you are right. It is a good idea. Can you ask Him if He is willing
to marry me?” The next day, Khadija’s friend
met the Prophet. “Why are you not yet married?” she asked Him straight away! “I don’t have the means for
 supporting a family” the Prophet replied truthfully. “What if you are let off from
 taking that responsibility?” she asked Him. “How is that possible?”
asked the Prophet “What do you think of Khadija?” she asked “I hold her in great esteem. She is a wise, pious and a kind woman.”
 He replied “What if she would like to marry you?”
she asked Him. The prophet was surprised! He respected Khadija a lot
for giving Him work,  but the thought of marriage
never occurred to him. “I will give you an answer after talking to my uncle.”
He said. When the Prophet told his uncle
about the proposal, Abu Talib was very happy! He knew that Khadija was a good woman, and he was so happy for his nephew. The Prophet informed his uncle’s
approval to Khadija(Rali Allahu Anha) and they got married to each other
very soon! For the first few days,Prophet
 and Khadija(Rali Allahu Anha)  lived at Abu Talib’s house. Soon they shifted to a very large house. The Prophet and Khadija
 lived together in their new house happily. Khadija handed over all her
business to her husband. Prophet used her wealth wisely, and soon he became one of the
richest man in Makkah. Khadija(Rali Allahu Anha) 
gave birth to six children two boys and four girls. However both the boys died
when they were still infants. They named the daughters- Zaynab,Ruqayya, Umm Kulthum and Fatima. They grew up into
young and beautiful girls. Years went by. But there were many questions that kept 
arising in His mind every now and then. He often went on top of Mount Hira,from
where He could see the whole Makkah. Most of his doubts were the same as
what Prophet Ibrahim(Alaihissalam) had. He wondered who created this world, and how the humans were created. He thought about his purpose in this world. He wondered what would happen once He died. He gazed at the stars and kept thinking
about these questions. He loved spending more and more time alone
at Mount Hira. Khadija would often send Fatima,  their youngest daughter with
food and water to him. It was during one of these nights
when no one was near him, that an angel appeared before Him!! Prophet was amazed by
the sight of this angel! He couldn’t believe His eyes!! The Angel then asked the Prophet to read! But how could the Prophet read, when He had never gone to a school? “I am not a reader” He said to the angel. Then suddenly, the angel took hold of Him, and squeezed Him tightly! The angel said again  “Read” “I am not a reader"" The Prophet cried again! The angel then squeezed
the Prophet so hard, that He thought that He would faint! And he said “Read! In the Name of Your
Lord and cherisher, who created man,out of  a clot
of congealed blood. Read! And your Lord in the most Generous, Who has taught writing by the pen- taught man which he knew not” The Prophet repeated the words
 with a trembling heart! Perplexed by His experience, Prophet made His way to home. As soon as He entered His house,  He said to His wife “Wrap me up!  Wrap me up!” He was trembling as He was He said this, and She wrapped Him up in a towel,  until His fear was gone. He explained to his wife
what had happened. When He finished,He asked Her if She 
She thought He had gone mad! “Allah forbid!” She replied “He will surely not let such a
thing happen, for you speak the truth, you are faithful in trust,
you assist your fellow men” Then She went to Her cousin
Warawa Ibn Naufal, who was old and blind. But He knew the scriptures
 quite well, he had translated them into Arabic. When She told him about what happened
 to Her Husband,he cried out. “Holy! Holy! This is the Holy Spirit
that came to Musa! He will be the Prophet for His people! Tell Him this and ask Him
to be brave at heart! The Prophet continued to receive
revelations for the remainder of His life. It was memorized and written
down by His companions on sheepskins Slowly Prophet started understanding
the meanings of revelations. He realized that He was now responsible
 for spreading the message of Quran. Mashallah!
That was such a great story. I'm glad you liked my son. Are there any more stories of
Beevi Fathima(Rali Allahu Anha) uncle? Yes my son, There are many other interesting stories. I will tell you those later. It's time for me to leave Good Bye! Good Bye! Maasalam Maasalam uncle Yusuf"
"Assalamu Alaikum Waalaikum Assalam You are early today I wanted to hear more stories
of Hazrat Imam Ali Of course, They are many more. Alright, sit there. Inshallah, I will tell you some more stories of
Hazrat Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib(Rali Allahu Anhu) Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) always
 dressed poorly and ate simple food. Even beggars in Kufa ate
better food than the Caliph. He did so because he wanted to spend all
that he could on the poor and needy in the city. Once he was having his
breakfast when he had a guest. The guest saw that Hazrat Ali had a cup of
water and some barley bread in front of him He could see that the bread did not have any
oil or butter and it was very hard and stale. Hazrat Ali was trying very hard
to break the bread into pieces. Seeing this, the guest asked
Ali’s servant Bibi Fizza “Fizza, Don’t you have
any pity on your master? Why don’t you add some oil in the bread so
that your master can have softer bread? “Why should I pity him when
he is so hard on himself” said Bibi Fizza. “He has given strict orders
to add nothing to his bread. He even asked us not to separate the chaff  and husks from the flour. Even though we are servants,
 we have much better food than him” Hearing this guest said to Hazrat Ali,  “O Master, have pity on yourself. Look at your age and your responsibilities, and is this what you are eating?” “O friend” replied Hazrat Ali. You have no idea what Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) used to eat. He hardly had any food, and sometime he never ate a full stomach
 for three days in a stretch!. If the holy messenger
could suffer like that, then I too should avoid any
luxuries in my life.” The guest understood the nobility
 in Hazrat Ali’s actions, and he never repeated the
question ever again. Once after a hard days work,  Hazrat Imam Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu)  was sitting under a tree and
eating his barley bread. A beggar who was passing by
saw him and went to Ali. The beggar told him that he was hungry and
asked if he could offer him some food. Imam Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) readily
offered to share what he was eating and gave a piece of bread to the beggar. The old beggar thanked him,
and took the bread from him. But he found it very
hard to chew the bread! The beggar returned the bread and told
him that the bread was too hard for him. Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) then asked
the beggar to go to Imam Hassan’s house,  and told him that he would get
good hot food there. The beggar thanked him and
left for Imam Hassan’s house. The beggar arrived at Imam
Hassan’s house as he was told He was surprised to find that a huge
 banquet was spread out, and many people eating food there. When Imam Hassan
(Rali Allahu Anhu) saw the beggar, he invited the beggar to join them. The beggar started
eating the food, but while he was doing it, he ate one mouthful and then keep one mouthful
 of food in a separate bowl. Imam Hassan (Rali Allahu Anhu) was
confused seeing this. So he asked the beggar  “Why are you putting food in the bowl?” “I met a good man today  who was
eating dry barley bread with salt. He was so kind that he told
me to come here for food. I want to give him some
food for his kindness” When Imam Hassan (Rali Allahu Anhu)
 heard this,  he smiled and said “That man is none other than
Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib. This is house. Even though he could lead a luxurious life,
he chsose to lead the life of a poor. He is a true muslim. Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) liked
farming as well. He used to work very hard in the
fields for cultivating crops. He had just bought a plot of
barren land outside Medinah. He wanted to cultivate this land
and for this, he needed water. Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) decided to
dig a well to get the water. The land was barren and there
were no hopes of getting any water. He placed his hopes on Allah
(Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala) and started to dig. He worked very hard that day, and when it was evening he went home. He arrived at the field early morning
next day and started digging again. He continued this routine for many days, but there was no sign of any water. One day, Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) took his pickaxe and entered the well. He used all his strength
and worked very hard. Unfortunately there was
no sign of water yet. Exhausted, he came out of the
well, and took rest for a while. He entered the well again  started digging with all his might. Such was his vigour that his breathing could be heard
 by nearby people. In one last effort, he struck
a rock with all his strength. It was a miracle! The ground split open, and fresh
clear water came from below! Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) was happy
and he got out of the well. The water rose up, and it
was such a wonderful well. He looked at the well and realized that this well would soon turn the
surrounding dry desert to a lovely farm! Soon the people gathered around
to see the well. Everyone was surprised! “Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib is really
a hard working man” someone said. “Allah(Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala) has been
 generous to him and because He is such a good man!”
 said another. Most of the people were happy, and they congratulated him for
 what he had done. But not everyone was so happy. “He and his descendants have become
 rich forever!”  said his haters. They were jealous that he had found
water in this dry desert. Now the value of land
would rise considerably. “Bring me a paper and pen”
said Hazrat Ali. When he got what he asked,
he sat down and wrote: “I am donating this well and the land surrounding it in charity, and its income should be used as follows: In helping the poor,  in helping the travellers,  in providing the means for the
 marriages of orphans, in providing medical care for the poor,  in doing good works
for the public benefit. I am donating the well to seek the pleasure
 of Allah (Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala).” Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) had such humility,  that even his haters started loving him. Mashallah, that was
such a great story! I’m glad you liked it my son. I will tell you another story tomorrow. Thanks! Massalam  Yousuf uncle May Allah bless you! Massalam Abu. Good bye! Good bye!"
"Assalamu Alaikum
Walaikum Assalam! Are you ready for today’s story? Yes I am! I really want to know
what happened to Benyamin! Alright..
Now listen carefully Bismillah Prophet Yusuf (as)- The
Secret Disclosed!! In the last episode,
we saw how the Prophet had placed a Golden cup
inside Benyamin’s saddle bag. He did this so that he could
keep Benyamin at the palace. Then the prophet replied
calmly  “How can I set him free knowing that  he stole the King’s cup?
It would be sinful!” Judah the eldest of the brothers was much worried, and
he told the others “We promised our father that
we will bring Benyamin back. I will stay back here, and
I will not leave this land until my father permits me, or
until Benyamin is released. The brothers left enough
provisions for Judah, who stayed at a tavern
awaiting the fate of Benyamin. The prophet secretly
arranged to watch over Judah’s well being as well. The prophet was
testing the sincerity of the brothers, and
he wanted to find if they would return
for their brothers. After many days of travelling, the brothers reached their house “Father, your son has stolen!” one of the brother said The old prophet was confused and he didn’t understand
what they meant. So he asked them to
explain what had happened The brothers told
him everything- how they were given a
feast at the palace, how they got the grains,
and how the kings golden cup was found in
Benyamin’s saddlebag When the prophet
heard their story, he knew that Allah
had a hand in it, and understood that
Allah was testing him. He was made to suffer
for Yusuf before, and now he was made to
suffer for Benyamin. He knew that God testing him, otherwise He would
not make him suffer for two of his sons.
He then said “Perhaps, Allah will bring
all of them to me. Allah is the
All-Knowing, All-wise!” He found solace in prayers,
and it strengthened his faith and patience as well. The Prophet had wept
for so many years over the loss of his
son Yusuf (as), and now he wept for
Benyamin as well. After weeping for so many years, the Prophet had now
lost his sight! “O father, why are you destroying yourself
in this way?” pleaded his sons “I complain of my grief
and sorrow to Allah. I know from Allah what you do
not know” The prophet replied. He then asked his sons to go to Egypt once again,
and not to give up hope. When they arrived in
Egypt, they took Judas, and went to meet Yusuf (as) They begged and they
pleaded to the Prophet. By now, Sorrow and love
rose up in the Prophet. He could no longer
bear to listen to the griefs of his own brothers.
He thought “How long can I
conceal the truth from them when
they are in need?” “How long can I go without
seeing my father?” Then he told them “Do you know what you did to Yusuf
and his brother when you were ignorant?” The brothers knew that
this was a secret known only to
themselves and Yusuf. “Are you our brother,
Yusuf?” They asked him “I am Yusuf” He replied, “and Benyamin is my brother.
Allah has been good to us Whoever fears Allah
and is patient, Allah always rewards them!” The brothers began to
tremble with fear, but Yusuf comforted them. “We have sinned
brother” they said. “Allah has certainly
preferred you more than us” “May Allah forgive
you” said the Prophet. “He is the most Merciful
of the Merciful” The Prophet then embraced his
brothers, and wept with Joy. It was not possible for
him to leave Egypt as he had many responsibilities. So he advised his brothers
to leave without him. He gave them his shirt and
said “Take this shirt of mine, and throw it over
my father’s face. He will recover his sight. Then bring me all
of your family” The brothers agreed,
and left for Caanan. As the caravan approached
Caanan, Yaqub (as) sensed the scent of
Yusuf in the air! He stood up all of a sudden, got dressed, and went to
meets his sons . “Yaqub has come out
of his room today!” The wife of his
eldest son remarked. “How do you feel today?”
Asked the other “I can smell Yusuf in the
air” replied the prophet. The wives then left him alone, saying that there
was no hope for him “He will die weeping
over Yusuf” said one “He said he could smell him! He has gone mad” said another. That night the old man asked for a
glass of milk to break his fasting. As the Caravan
approached nearer, the old Prophet kept
praying to the Lord And when the Caravan
finally arrived, the old prophet went
outside and asked “I smell Yusuf in the air! Is
it real, or am I hallucinating? “You are certainly mistaken”
said one of the wives. But the prophet was
indeed telling the truth! The bearer of the
good news arrived, and placed Yusuf’s
shirt over his face! It was a miracle! As soon
as the shirt was placed, Yaqub (as) got his sight back!!! “Didn’t I tell you
that I know from Allah what you don’t know?”
He said to them happily The brothers realized
their mistake. “We have sinned father.
Please ask forgiveness for our actions” they said. “I will ask Lord to forgive you, He is All-Forgiving and
All-Merciful” replied the Prophet! Then the Old Prophet left
for Egypt to meet his son. Yusuf (as) received him
with great joy! Then Yusuf (as) placed his
father on the throne!! The old prophets happiness
knew no bounds. Then his father and
all his brothers prostrated before Yusuf (as) “This is the the dream that I saw when I was young”
said Yusuf (as). “I saw eleven stars,
the sun and the moon bowing down to me. My
Lord has made it true!” The prophet then met the king, seeking permission for his
family to settle down in Egypt. The prophet was a great
asset to the Kingdom, and the King was
very happy to agree. The great power and
responsibility did not distract the
Prophet from Allah (swt). He remembered and worshipped
Allah all the time. The prophet did not want to
die the death of a king. He did not like to
be gathered around the people of royalty.
He wanted to die the death of a slave
to Allah, and to be gathered around the righteous. Yusuf (as), at the
time of his death, asked his brothers to bury
him beside his forefathers. So when he passed away,
he was mummified and placed in a coffin until a suitable
time to be taken out of Egypt. It is said that he died at the age of One hundred and ten!! Mashallah! That was
such a great story!! Now are you ready
for the questions? Yes I am!! Alright, now tell me how did Prophet Yaqub (as) know that his son was coming? Yusuf had given his
shirt to his brothers. When the caravan
they were travelling approached the house of Yaqub, he got the smell
of his shirt and realized that his lost
son was returning! Mashallah! That’s
the correct answer. Now tell me how did
Yaqub regain his sight? Yaqub regained his sight
when his eyes were covered with the Yusuf’s shirt. That’s right again! And now
for the last question. Where did Prophet Yusuf (AS) die? He died in Egypt, at the
age of one hundred and ten That’s brilliant my son.
That’s all for today, I will tell you the story of another Prophet tomorrow. Good night my son Good night!"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! How was your school today? It was good uncle,
how was your work? It was fine Abu. So have you finished
your homework? Yes uncle. I had finished that
as soon as I reached home Very good Abu So are you ready for the story then? I am Uncle, which story are
you going to tell me today? Inshallah,  I will tell you the story of Hazrat
Ammar Ibn Yasir (Rali Allahu Anhu) today. Are you ready? Yes uncle, I am Bismillahirrahmanirrahim The Story of Hazrat Ammar Ibn
Yasir (Rali Allahu Anhu) Hazrat Ammar Ibn Yasir (Rali Allahu Anhu )
 was one of the Muhajirun  in the history of Islam. Muhajiruns were the first set of
people who got converted into Islam. Ammar ibn Yasir(Rali Allahu Anhu)  is considered to be one of the
most  loyal and beloved companions of Prophet
 Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam ). He was one of the most reputed
and respected companion. He was the first Muslim to build a mosque
 in his own house to worship Allah(Subhanahu wa taala). Ammar Ibn Yasir(Rali Allahu Anhu)
belonged to Banu Makhzum tribe in Arabia. He was born in the same year as the Prophet
Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) was born. His father's name was Yasir. He had lost one of his
brothers when he was young. He accompanied his father,
 along with his two brothers, when they went searching
 for his lost brother. They travelled to
Mecca to find him. After they finished searching for their
 lost brother in Mecca, his brothers returned to their homeland. But Yasir chose to stay back in Mecca. Yasir had no house to live in Mecca, so he entered into a covenant with a
 rich man named Abu Hudhayfah Yasir agreed to marry his
slave-girl, Sumayyah bint Khayyat. Yasir and Sumayyah lived
happily, and they had two sons. Ammar Ibn Yasir (Rali Allahu Anhu) 
was their second son. But He was considered to be the slave of Abu
Hudhayfah as per the custom prevailing in Arabia. Ammar(Rali Allahu Anhu) and his parents
were among the first to convert to Islam. Ammar (Rali Allahu Anhu ) converted to Islam under the direct
 influence of Abu Bakr (Rali Allahu Anhu) who was the father in law of  Prophet
 Muhammad(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) The situation in Mecca was not favorable 
for the Prophet’s followers during those times. The people in Mecca belonged to either of
the two classes-  The rich or the poor. The rich persecuted the poor and
subjected them to harsh treatments. The poor people mostly
worked as slaves. They had nothing, not
even their freedom. The rich people controlled the
weak and made them suffer a lot. No one was there to support
the weak and the poor. The most prominent leaders of Mecca
were from the Qurayshi tribe. Qurayshi leaders were traders
and they were very rich. Ammar (Rali Allahu Anhu) and his parents
were the slaves to their master Abu Huzaifa,  who was a companion of the Prophet 
Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) After the death of Abu Huzaifa,  a rich man named Abu Jahl took
  Ammar and his family as his slaves. Abu Jahl later became one of
Islam's most brutal enemies. When Yasir got converted to Islam, the news
soon reached Abu Jahl, his new master. He was very angry at his servant. He led a group of men from the Quraishi
tribe and went to Yasir's house. They threw flaming torches on Yasir’s
house and burnt down his house! Yasir and his family were sleeping
 when this happened, and when fire caught up, they got up. They saw the that their house
 was in flames,  and ran out for saving their lives! They were shocked to see the furious
Quraishi men waiting for them outside. The Qurayshis caught them and took
them to a desert outside Mecca. They tortured them without
showing any mercy! Some of the men were laughing while
the family cried out in pain. In spite of all the tortures they were
not ready to give up their new faith. When Abu Jahl found that Yasir and family were not
ready to give up on their love towards prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) he started torturing
them more brutally. He ordered rocks to be put on their chests. They were not able to breathe properly. But, still they kept their
faith close to their heart. It was noon. Abu Jahal and his men left Yasir's
family in the desert, under the scorching sun. He came back to Mecca. When it was evening, Abu Jahal and his men came back. Abu Jahal was leading the group. There was a long
spear in his hand. He began torturing
them with the spear. He found extreme
happiness in doing so. Due to the severe torture with the spear
Ammar, Yasir and Sumayyah went unconscious The men then showered them
with water to wake them up. When they got up again from
 unconsciousness, Abu Jahal started shouting at them. He shouted at Sumayyah and asked her to praise the pagan Gods and 
curse their beloved Prophet. Sumayyah was a brave lady. She closed her ears when she
heard what Abu Jahl said. She spat on his face with anger. In extreme anger Abu Jahal raised
his spear high and stabbed her! Sumayyah died that day.  Sumayyah (  Rali Allahu Anha) mother of Ammar(Rali Allahu Anhu) became the first martyr in the
 history of Islam. Abu Jahl started torturing Ammar (Rali Allahu 
Anhu)’s father Yasir and killed him also. He too refused to move away from his faith and loyalty towards his beloved
 Prophet (Sallallahu alihi wasallam). Ammar (Rali allahu Anhu) saw what
happened to his parents and he wept. He was really helpless. Abu Jahl started shouting at 
Ammar (Rali Allahu Anhu) and threatened him that if he did not 
praise the pagan God he will be tortured and killed. Ammar could not endure
that cruel torture. So he reluctantly agreed
to praise the pagan god. After Ammar (Rali Allahu Anhu) started
 praising the pagan god, Abu Jahal unchained him and 
allowed him to escape. He started his journey to meet the Prophet 
Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) He loved the Prophet very much t  that he knew Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)  will help him to get back to his life. Oh, Allah, I feel really sad
after listening this story. How much he had suffered. He suffered a lot,  but that was a life changing
 incident in his life. I will tell you some more detailed story of 
Ammar(Rali Allahu Anhu) after the lunch. You will come to know why he
is an inspiration to many. Okay, mmm, common let
us have some lunch. Sure uncle."
"Assalamu-Alaikum! Walaikum As-salam! Are you ready for today’s story? Yes Baba! I’m going to tell you the story of
 Prophet Yusuf (as) today! Prophet Yusuf (as)? Yes my son The story of prophet Yusuf (as) is the most detailed and fascinating
stories in the Quran. Now listen carefully. The Dream of Prophet Yusuf (as) Prophet Yusuf (as) was the son of
 Prophet Yaqub (as) and Rahel. He had a younger brother named
Benyamin from his mother. Yaqub (as) had twelve sons in total. Prophet Yaqub (as) loved Yusuf (as)  and Benyamin more than
 his other children. This made the other brothers
very angry. One night Yusuf (as) had a
 wonderful dream! He saw eleven stars in the sky,
and the sun and the moon, they were all bowing
down before him! The young prophet was quite
 amazed by this dream! He wondered why stars bowed
 before  him. He didn’t understand the meaning, so he went to his father,
and told him about his dream “Father, I saw eleven stars, the sun
 and the moon in a dream!” He told his father. “I saw all of them bowing down to me!” Yaqub (as) was a prophet, and he understood the
 meaning of his dream, and he was very happy! “Allah (swt) has blessed you Yusuf”
The old prophet told his son. This dream means that you will be
 given knowledge and prophecy!” Yaqub (as) was a wise and old man, so he knew that his other sons would not be
 happy to hear about Yusuf’s dream. So he warned him “My son, do not tell any of your
 brothers about your dream. They will be jealous of you, and
 they will become your enemies. “No father, I will not tell them”
replied his son. But the young and innocent boy went and told his brothers about the dream. When the brothers heard about this,
they got really angry. “Why does our father love Yusuf
 more than us?” asked one of the brothers “Maybe its because he is so beautiful”
 replied another brother “Our father has gone astray”
said another “Why don’t we kill Yusuf, and get rid
 of him?” asked another brother “Where would we kill him?”
asked the other “We should send him away to a distant land”
 said another brother Then one of the brother said “There is no need to kill him
 to get rid of him. Look here, let us throw him into
 a well beside the road. He will be picked up by the travelers,
and they will take him as a slave to a distant land. He will disappear from
our father's eyes, and that will serve our
 purpose as well. Then the ten brothers went
to their father, and requested him to send Yusuf(as)
 along with them. But Yaqub (as) was very afraid
 for Yusuf(as). He knew that the brothers were
 jealous of him, and that they did not love him. He refused at first. “Yusuf is our dear little brother”
said one of them. We are the sons of the same father, so what are you afraid of?” “Please send him with us”
 said another brother “We will watch over him” “I fear the wolf may take him while
 you are playing” said Yaqub (as) “Never” replied a brother. “How can the wolf eat him
when we are there, we are strong and we can
save him father” After a lot of compulsion
from the brothers,  the prophet gave them permission to take
Yusuf(as) along with them. The next day, the brothers took Yusuf (as)
with them to the forest. They were very excited as they
 could finally get rid of him! They walked through the forest and
went directly to the well, as they had planned They leaned over the well on the
 pretext of drinking water. It was then that one of the brothers put
 his arms around Yusuf (as) and held him tightly. Startled by this unusual behaviour, Yusuf(as) struggled to free himself! Then all the brothers joined,
 and held him so that he couldn’t move. Then one of them removed his shirt. Together they lifted Yusuf (as) and
threw him into the deep well!! Yusuf (as) cried for help, and he begged
his brothers to save him. But the brothers shook their heads and paid no heed to the pleas
of their brother. Yusuf (as) was all alone in the
 deep dark well. He was very scared
 and he wept. It was then that Allah(swt) told him “Do not be sad,
do not be afraid. Allah is with you. Something great is going to
 happen to you . Your brothers will come before you and you
 will remind them of what they did. Yusuf (as) was saved by the
 shallow water. He then clung to a rock ledge,
and climbed on top of it. The brothers then got together and said “what shall we tell our father?” Then one of them said “We will tell him,
 You were right father, a wolf did eat him!” “Yes” the brothers agreed. “We will tell our father that
 the wolf ate him” The brothers then caught a
ram and killed it. Then they took Yusuf (as)'s shirt and
dipped it in the blood. “now our father will believe us”
they said. The brothers came weeping
to their father. “Father” they said “We went running races, and left
 Yusuf with our bags. But by the time we returned,
 a wolf ate our little brother!” “Yes father” said another
“Look at his shirt” But Yaqub (as) knew that
they were lying.  He was a prophet and a
very wise man. He knew that when a wolf eats someone,
it rips his clothes. But the shirt of Yusuf (as) was whole, and it had been only dipped in blood. That’s how the prophet knew that the
story of the wolf was made up! “This is a story that you have made up”
 he said to them. “I am a patient man and
 I will wait for my son” Yaqub (as) couldn’t sleep that night
 and kept thinking about his son. It was a terrible time for Yusuf (as),
 in that deep well, out in the wilderness,
hidden in darkness. It was a difficult time for both the
 father and the son. A group of people were travelling to
 Egypt through that wilderness. They were thirsty and
looking for water. When they saw the well, they sent a man
 to bring them some water. The man came to the well and
 let down a bucket. Yusuf (as) was happy when he saw the
 bucket coming down,  and he grabbed hold of it. As the man began to haul,  he felt the load was
unusually heavy! When he peeped into the well, he was shocked to see a young man
 clinging to the rope! He held the rope tightly, and shouted to his friends “Better give me hand fellows, looks like I found real treasure
 in the well!” His companions rushed to the well, to pull the stranger holding
 onto the rope! The men were startled when they saw
the handsome youth, beaming with an angelic smile! They knew that they would get a handsome
 price for this young man, and money was all that
mattered to them. They immediately chained Yusuf (as),
 and took him to Egypt, far away from his home Masha Allah! That was such a great story!! I’m glad you liked it They took him to Egypt, but I will tell
you that story tomorrow! Alright! Now are you ready for
 the questions? Yes, I am! Now tell me who was the mother of
 Prophet Yusuf (as) His mother was Rahel! That’s correct. Can you tell me about the dream that
 the Prophet saw? In his dream, the Prophet saw eleven stars
 in the sky, and the sun and the moon, and they all bowed down before him! That’s wonderful! Now tell me how the brothers got rid
 of the Prophet The brothers of Prophet Yusuf (as)
 was jealous of him. One day, they lied to their father, and took the Prophet
 along with them. They dumped him in a well,
after removing his clothes And what happened after that? They dipped his clothes in blood, and showed it to their father, telling him that the wolves ate him! Masha Allah!
That’s the right answer! Now, for the last question. Tell me how was the Prophet
 saved from the well A group a travelers came to the well to
get water, and they found him! Excellent! That’s the
 right answer! That’s all for today, I will tell you the
 remaining story tomorrow! Good night my son! Good night Baba! Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum As-salam! Are you ready for today's story? Yes That’s great, Inshallah!
I will tell you the story of how Prophet Yusuf (as) was
saved from the well and how he became a very
important person in Egypt! That’s great!
Please tell me the story Baba! In the last episode
we saw how Yusuf (as) was dumped in a well
by his brothers and how the travelers saved him Bismillah! Prophet Yusuf (as)
From the well to the palace! As they saved the prophet they chained him and
took him to Egypt. They travelled for many days
and nights through the desert. And after many days of travel they finally arrived in Egypt The travelers went to the market and put the prophet for auction “Who will buy this handsome
young boy?” they shouted The news spread fast and people gathered in hundreds to
watch the unusually handsome young boy. After an auction Aziz,the
chief minister of Egypt bought the young prophet
for a few silver coins. When they reached the palace the prophet was
pleasantly surprised when the chief minister ordered
his men to remove his chains. Aziz then told the prophet
 never to betray his trust and also promised him that
he never be ill-treated. “Make his stay comfortable
here” Aziz said to his wife. “He is such an
intelligent young man” Yusuf (as) felt at ease at last. He knew that he had a shelter and he was well taken care of. He thanked Allah (swt)
over and over again. It was not very long ago that he
was cast into a deep dark well with no hope of
coming out alive. Then he was enslaved
and he was chained. But now he could enjoy all
the luxuries of the palace and he had plenty of
food to eat as well. However his heart
ached with longing for his parents and his
little brother Benyamin. Yusuf (as) was made the personal
attendant of the chief minister’s wife. He was obedient and
ever-obliging. With his pleasant manners
and charming behaviour he won everybody’s heart. Soon Yusuf’s (as) beauty
became the talk of the town. People referred to
him as the most attractive man that
they had ever seen!. His face carried
immaculate beauty it was the purity of his
soul reflecting on his face! As he grew older he gained wisdom and knowledge. He soon became a good speaker always captivating the audience. His master realized that
Yusuf(as) was the most honest straightforward and noble
person he had met in his life. And after sometime he was
put in charge of the household and the chief minister
treated him like his son! The wife of the chief
minister Zulaikha admired Yusuf (as) very much. As she watched him and
listened to him speak her passion for the prophet
increased by the day The chief minister's wife could not
resist her temptations anymore and it caused her
sleepless nights. She was madly in love
with the prophet! Zulaikha could not control
her passion any longer. One day when the prophet was
alone with her in the bedroom she tried to kiss him! But Yusuf (as) denied as he was an upright
worshipper of Allah (swt). He then walked away from her. The prophet’s refusal heightened
the passion of Zulaikha As he was moving
towards the door she ran after him and she
caught hold of his shirt! While she was tugging she tore his shirt and she held
the torn piece in her hand! Then the door opened suddenly and there stood her husband
and another relative of hers Seeing her husband the crooked woman
immediately changed her tone. “Your man tried to grab me” she said showing him the
torn piece of cloth “you must put him in prison now” She was now trying to accuse
the prophet of molesting her! But the prophet denied it “It was she who tried
to grab me” he said. Aziz and her relative
examined the shirt to find out who was
saying the truth. They found out that the it
was torn at the back. The chief minister then
looked at his wife and said “If he was the one to attack you the shirt whould have
been torn in the front. But Yusuf’s shirt
is torn in the back which means you are lying. He said angrily When Aziz realized that
his wife had been lying he apologized to the prophet for
his wife’s indecent behavior. He then asked his wife to beg
forgiveness from the prophet! The news of the incident spread
in the town like a wildfire! “Look at her” some of them said “she tried to seduce her slave!” Others laughed at her behaviour Zulaikha was upset with
people gossiping about her. She honestly believed that it
was not easy for any woman to resist a man as
handsome as Yusuf (as). To prove her helplessness she planned to subject the women to
the same temptation that she had faced She decided to invite
all the women in her circle  for a banquet
at her palace! The banquet was reserved
exclusively for women. Everyone who were invited
turned up for the event and most of them
secretly hoped that they would get a chance
to see Yusuf (as)!. Then suddenly Zulaikha
decided to open the topic. “Listen everyone” she
spoke to the guests “I have heard of those who say
that I am in love with my slave” At once everybody stopped
what they were doing and fixed their gaze on the
Chief minister's wife. “I admit that he is
a charming fellow. I do not deny that I love him as I have loved him
for a long time” Everyone at the banquet were
stunned to hear this confession coming from none other than the
wife of the chief minister! In the meantime Zulaikha asked her servants to
distribute the fruits among the guests. After finishing the dinner the guests began
cutting their fruit It was at this
moment that Zulaikha summoned Yusuf (as) to
make an appearance. He entered the hall gracefully
with his gaze lowered. When Zulaikha called him by
name he raised his head. The guests were astonished
and dumbfounded when they saw the
face of Yusuf (as). His face was shining
with angelic beauty. It reflected pure innocence so much that one could feel the
peace in the depth of his soul! They exclaimed in astonishment
while they were cutting the fruit. As all of their eyes
were on the prophet the women began to cut
their palms absent mindedly  without feeling any pain! One of the ladies gasped “This is not a mortal being” another stammered “
He is a noble angel!” All their attention
were on the prophet and no one noticed the blood
flowing from their hands Then Zulaikha stood up. “Look at your hands”
she said to them When the women looked
at their hands they realized that
they were bleeding and they wrapped their
towel on top of it. “Its because of him that I
have been blamed” she said. “I do not deny that I
tried to seduce him”. “You too would have
been enchanted by him and see what happened
to your hands!” “If he refuses to
obey my order again then he shall be put in
prison” she said to everyone “Oh Lord” the prophet
calmly replied. “I would rather go to the
prison than committing a sin” The prophet then quietly left
the room with his gaze lowered. That night Zulaikha
convinced her husband that the only way to save her honor
was by imprisoning the prophet. The chief minister loved
the prophet like a son and he knew that
he was innocent. He had never met another man
who was so loyal to him. It was with a heavy heart that Aziz ordered Yusuf (as)
to be arrested and imprisoned. It was not an easy
decision for him to put an innocent man behind the bars. However he was left
with no choice. That day the prophet was chained
and put inside a prison. And this is where he had
to face his third test! The third test? Yes Amir I will tell you
about that tomorrow! Mashallah! that was
such a great story!! Alright.. Now are you
ready for the questions? Yes! Now tell me who bought the
Prophet at the auction? It was the chief minister!! What was his name? His name was.. His name was.. Aziz! That’s correct my son! Now tell me why did the Prophet
walk away from Zuleikha the wife of the chief minister? She was trying to kiss the
prophet but the Prophet refused. He then walked away Why was the Prophet sent to jail even though the Chief minister
knew that he was not guilty? Zuleikha the wife of Aziz proved that no woman
can resist their temptations when the
Prophet was around. She proved her case and
Aziz was left with no choice other than
to imprison him Masha Allah! That was very good. I will tell you the
remaining story tomorrow. Good night Amir Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam Baba! So are you ready
for today's story? Yes! Alright now listen carefully Bismillah! Prophet Yusuf (as)
And The King's Dream In the last episode we saw how Yusuf (as) was put in prison in spite of being innocent. It was in the prison that the
prophet had to face his third test! It was during this
period that Allah (swt) blessed him with an
extraordinary gift! The prophet was blessed with the
ability to interpret dreams! The people in the prison
 knew that Yusuf (as) was a noble young man with great knowledge
and a merciful heart. They loved and respected him At about the same time two other men landed
in the prison. One was the cupbearer
of the king and the other was
the king's cook. That night both the new
inmates had a strange dream! When they woke up they were confused as they could not
understand the meaning of the dream The next day when
they saw the prophet they realized that he was
not a common criminal. They approached him and
told him about their dream. “I had a very strange dream” I saw that I was standing in a
place with bread on my head. There were two birds eating
the bread on top of my head! On hearing this the prophet first called
them to Allah (swt). He told them the
meaning of his dream. The dream meant that the cook was
going to be crucified until he died. Then the prophet asked the cupbearer
to tell him about his dream “I saw that I was standing
inside the palace” said the cupbearer “and I was serving
wine to the king!” The prophet prayed for some time and he said that the cupbearer
will be soon let free and that he will return to
the service of the king The prophet then asked the cupbearer
to talk to the king about him and tell him that there
was a wronged soul named Yusuf in the prison. What the prophet
predicted soon happened and the cook was crucified just like the prophet foretold. The cupbearer returned
to the palace as well But as soon as he
returned to service Shaytan made him forget
about the prophet. And therefore Yusuf (as) remained in
prison for a few more years. After a few years one night the king was
sleeping in his palace. The king had a strange
dream that night and in his dream he saw that he was standing
at the banks of river Nile. He saw that the water was
receding revealing the bare mud. He saw the fish
skipping and jumping without water. Then he saw seven fat cows
emerging from the water followed by seven lean cows The lean cows then began
swallowing the fat cows! The king was terrified
seeing this! He then saw seven ears of green
corn growing by the riverbank. Suddenly they disappeared and in its place grew
seven dry ears of corn!! The king woke up terrified
from his dream. He was shocked and depressed as he could not understand
the meaning of his dream The next day he called his
ministers, priests and advisors and told them about his dream. The sorcerers said “This is a very confusing dream! How can any of that happen?” The priests said “Perhaps you had
a heavy dinner!” “May be you slept
without a blanket!” said the chief minister All of them said that
it was only a nightmare and there was nothing
to worry about! The news reached the cupbearer. He recollected the dream that he
had while he was in prison and suddenly he
remembered Yusuf (as). He ran to the king to tell
him about the prophet. “He had asked me to tell
you about his innocence” He said to the king
“but I forgot” When he explained how Yusuf (as) had interpreted his
dream while in prison King sent him to
meet the prophet. The cupbearer met the prophet and
told him about the King’s dream The prophet prayed to
Allah(swt) and then explained the meaning
of the dream. “There will be seven years of
rich harvest in the kingdom” He said. “If the land is
cultivated properly there will be a good harvest and people will have
more than enough food” “This will be followed by seven
years of drought in the kingdom. People will not
have enough to eat and there will be scarcity
of food all over Egypt.” When the cupbearer told the
king about the interpretation the King was fascinated! He commanded that Yusuf
(as) be set free and presented
before him at once! When the king's envoy arrived
at the prison to set him free the prophet refused
to leave the prison. “I will not leave the prison until my innocence is
proven” he told them The envoy returned to the king “Where is Yusuf?”
asked the king. “Did I not command
you to fetch him?” “He refused to leave until his
innocence is established” they replied The king realized that the prophet
was unfairly put in prison so he immediately
ordered an enquiry. Zulaikha, wife of the chief minister
was brought into his court and so were the wives
of the other ministers who had attended the
lavish banquet. “What is the story of Yusuf?” The king asked them. “Is it true that he tried to
molest the chief minister’s wife?” “He didn’t do anything”
said one woman “He did her no
harm” said another “He is innocent as the
angels” said another. Everyone’s attention now
turned to Zulaikha. She now wore a wrinkled face. She was overwhelmed with sorrow
while the prophet was in prison. “I tempted him but he refused” she boldly confessed. “So he is innocent as
he says” said the king. When the prophet
came to the palace the King was stunned by
this handsome young man. He spoke to the prophet for a
while to test his knowledge. The replies of the
prophet stunned the king and he was convinced that he
was very intelligent indeed! Then the conversation
turned to the dream. The prophet advised
the king to start planning for years
of famine ahead. He informed the king that the
famine would not only affect Egypt but all other neighboring
countries as well. The king then appointed the prophet
as the controller of granaries. It was his responsibility to
guard the nations harvest and make plans for the
anticipated famine. The wheels of time
had turned by now. The prophet who was in
prison till a few months ago had now become one of the
senior most officials in Egypt. During the seven good
years that followed the prophet had full control
over the cultivation. harvesting and storage of crops. He did his duties faithfully and he carefully saved the grains
for the harsh years ahead. What happened next? I will tell you the
remaining story tomorrow! Masha Allah! That was such a
wonderful story!! Baba, did the prophet ever
see his father again? You will have to wait till
tomorrow to know that! Ok.. So are you ready
for the questions? Yes!! Alright now tell me what were
the occupation of the two men who landed in prison
along with the prophet? One was a cook and the other was..
A cupbearer! That’s correct Now tell me about
the king's dream The king dreamt that
he was standing at the banks of river Nile. While he was standing there he saw seven fat cows
coming out of the water and then seven lean
cows came out. The lean cows then
swallowed the fat cows! Mashallah! And what
about the rest? Then the king saw seven green ears
of corn growing by the river. These green ears disappeared
and in its place there was seven dry ears of corn And what did the dream mean? The dream meant that the
country was going to receive a rich harvest for the
next seven years. And then there was going to be
seven long years of drought. That’s very good! Why did the prophet refuse
to come out of the prison? The prophet wanted his
innocence to be proved that’s why he stayed
in the prison That’s right again! And how did the king
prove his innocence? The king called the wife of chief
minister along with other women and questioned them. But this time everyone
said the truth and the prophet was
proved innocent. That’s correct my son. And now for the last question. What position did the
king offer the prophet? The prophet was made the
controller of granaries! Masha Allah! You gave all the right
answers my son. Now that’s all for today I will tell you the
remaining story tomorrow. Good night Good night Baba! Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! So excited to hear
the remaining story? I was waiting for you Baba! Alright.. I will tell
you the story now. Now listen carefully Bismillah! Prophet Yusuf (as) meets
his brother Benyamin! Prophet Yusuf (as)
had now become the controller of the
granaries in Egypt. During the seven good
years the prophet had full control
over the cultivation harversting and
storage of crops. The prophet saved enough grains
during the abundant years. And then like the
prophet had predicted drought followed and famine spread
throughout the nation. The leaves turned yellow and not even a single drop
of rain fell from the sky. But nobody in Egypt
died of hunger for the prophet had saved more than
enough grains for the harsh years. “You were right Yusuf” the
king said to the prophet “Its only because of you that
our people are not suffering” “All our neighbors are
asking for our help what should I tell them?
He asked “Allah(swt) saved us”
the prophet replied. “We have plenty of
grains with us. I think this is the time we
should help our neighbours. We can give them the
grains at a small price. Many lives can be saved” “I agree with you”
the King said. He then ordered to distribute the
grains evenly to those in need. This famine affected
Canaan as well. Prophet Yaqub (as) heard the news of
grains being distributed in Egypt. He decided to send his sons
to Egypt to get the grains all of them except Benyamin The brothers travelled for many
days and finally arrived in Egypt. Prophet Yusuf (as) heard
about the ten brothers who had arrived from
a distant land. When they arrived to
collect the grains the prophet immediately
recognized them! But the brothers didn’t! How could they? To them he no longer existed! They had thrown him in
the well many years ago! The prophet then met them
and welcomed them warmly. After giving them the provisions he asked where
they had come from “We are elven brothers
son of a noble prophet. We come from Caanan”
they replied “I count only ten here” the prophet asked them “Our youngest brother is at home tending our father's needs. On hearing this the prophet’s
eyes filled up with tears! He longed to meet his father
and his little brother. “Are you truthful
people” He asked them The brothers were confused. “What reasons do we have to
lie to you?” they asked him “If what you say is the truth then bring your youngest brother
and I’ll double your rations. But if you do not
bring him to me then you better not try entering
Egypt again” He warned them The brothers agreed and said that they
will need their father's permission. The prophet then asked his servant
to place the bag of money they paid secretly in one of
the grain sacks. After many days of travel
they reached Caanan. They greeted their
father and said “We were denied some supplies because
you didn't let Benyamin come with us. The controller of granaries has
promised to give us extra provisions if you let him come with us. Please father send him with us and we shall take
good care of him! But the old prophet said sadly “I will never let
Benyamin travel with you. How can I trust you knowing
what you did with Yusuf? Later when they
opened the grain sack they were surprised to find
their money purse inside “Look father” they said. “The noble official has
returned our money!” ”This is a proof that they
will not harm our brother” But the Old Prophet
refused again After a few months when
they had no more grains Prophet Yaqub (as) asked
them to travel to Egypt. ""We cannot go there
without Benyamin” said one of the brothers They reminded him of the warning
given by the Egyptian official. The old prophet finally agreed but only after they took an
oath to bring him back safely. “Allah(swt) is witness
to your pledge” he reminded them
before they left. The prophet blessed them
as they set off for Egypt and prayed for their protection The brothers travelled for
many days through the desert and they took good care
of Benyamin as well! When they arrived in Egypt Yusuf (as) welcomed
them heartily. He prepared a feast for them and made them seated in pairs. The prophet sat next to his beloved
brother Benyamin. He noticed that
Benyamin was weeping “Why are you crying” he
asked his little brother “if my brother Yusuf
had been here I would have sat next to
him” Benyamin replied. That night when the prophet and
Benyamin were alone in the room the prophet asked his brother “Would you like to have
me as your brother?” But Benyamin
respectfully answered that he regarded him
as a wonderful person but he could never take
the place of his brother. On hearing this the prophet
broke down and said. “Benyamin! I am your
brother who was lost! Fate has brought us together
after so many years! Benyamin exploded with
joy when he heard this!! “Listen to me” said the prophet “This should remain a
secret for the time being” Benyamin agreed and he flung
his arms around the prophet. They cried and shed
tears of Joy!! The next day while the brothers
were loading the bags of grains the prophet ordered
one of his servants to keep the golden
measuring cup inside Benyamin’s saddlebag secretly. When the brothers
were ready to set out the soldiers came
running to them “O brothers! Stop there!
You are thieves!” shouted the soldiers When the people
around heard this they gathered around
the brothers. “What have you lost?” asked
the confused brothers “The King’s Golden
Cup” said the soldier “We didn’t come here to
steal” said another brother The prophet had instructed one of
the soldiers to ask the brothers the following question “What punishment would
you give for a thief?” “According to our law whoever steals becomes a slave
to the owner of the property” answered a brother “We shall apply your law instead
of the Egyptian law then"" said the soldiers. They started searching
their bags one by one. When they reached Benyamin they pulled out the
King’s Cup from his bag! The brothers were stunned! They thought of their father
and the pledge they had taken. They began to beg the
Prophet for mercy! “Yusuf! O Minister take one
of us instead” they pleaded I really want to know what
happened to the prophet That I will tell you
in the next episode!! What happened then? Don’t worry my son..
Its getting very late I will tell you the remaining
story tomorrow for sure! Oh..no Shall I ask you a few
questions from the story? Of course.. go ahead Baba! Alright.. Now tell me what
happened to the Prophet after he was released from jail Prophet Yusuf (as) became the
controller of granaries in Egypt. What happened then? During the seven good years the prophet
had full control over the cultivation harvesting and storage of crops. The prophet saved enough grains
during the abundant years And then like the
prophet had predicted drought followed and famine
spread throughout the nation. Did anybody die in Egypt
because of hunger? No.. nobody in Egypt
died of hunger for the prophet had saved more than
enough grains for the harsh years. Masha Allah that’s
the right answer! Now tell me why did the
brothers arrive in Egypt? The famine affected
Canaan as well. Prophet Yaqub (as) heard the news of
grains being distributed in Egypt. He sent his sons to Egypt
to get the grains. That’s right again! Did the brothers really steal
the King’s Golden cup? No.. They did not. The Prophet had
instructed one of his men to keep the cup inside
Benyamin’s saddle bag. He did this to keep
Benyamin at the palace Masha Allah! 
That’s very good my son! I will tell you the
remaining story tomorrow! Good night my son Good night Baba! Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! Are you ready for today’s story? Yes I am! I really want to know
what happened to Benyamin! Alright..
 Now listen carefully Bismillah! Prophet Yusuf (as)- The
Secret Disclosed!! In the last episode,  we saw how the Prophet  place a golden cup
 inside Benyamin's  saddle bag. He did this so that he could
keep Benyamin at the palace. Then the prophet replied calmly “How can I set him free knowing that
he stole the King's cup? It would be sinful!” Judah, the eldest of the brothers 
was much worried  and he told the others “We promised our father that
we will bring Benyamin back. I will stay back here, and
I will not leave this land until my father permits me, or
until Benyamin is released. The brothers left enough
provisions for Judah, who stayed at a tavern
awaiting the fate of Benyamin. The prophet secretly arranged to watch over
Judah’s well being as well. The prophet was testing the
 sincerity of the brothers  and he wanted to find if they would return
for their brothers. After many days of travelling, the brothers reached their house “Father, your son has stolen!” one of the brother said The old prophet was confused and he didn't 
understand what they meant So he asked them to
explain what had happened The brothers told
him everything- how they were given a
feast at the palace, how they got the grains, and how 
the kings golden cup was found  in Benyamin’s saddle bag When the prophet
heard their story, he knew that Allah(swt)
had a hand in it, and understood that
Allah(swt) was testing him. He was made to suffer
for Yusuf before, and now he was made to
suffer for Benyamin. He knew that God testing him, otherwise He would not make him suffer
for two of his sons He then said “Perhaps, Allah(swt) will bring
all of them to me. Allah(swt) is the
All-Knowing, All-wise!” He found solace in his prayers, and it strengthened his faith 
and patience as well. The Prophet had wept for so many years
over the loss of his son Yusuf (as), and now he wept for
Benyamin as well. After weeping for so many years, the Prophet had now
lost his sight! “O father, why are you
destroying yourself in this way?” pleaded his sons “I complain of my grief
and sorrow to Allah(swt) I know from Allah((swt) what you do
not know” The prophet replied. He then asked his sons
to go to Egypt once again and not to give up hope. When they arrived in
Egypt, they took Juda, and they went to meet Yusuf (as) They begged and they
pleaded to the Prophet. By now, sorrow and love
rose up in the Prophet. He could no longer bear to listen
to the griefs of his own brothers. He thought “How long can I conceal the truth
from them when they are in need?” “How long can I go without
seeing my father?” Then he told them  “Do you know what you did to Yusuf
and his brother when you were ignorant?” The brothers knew that
this was a secret known only to
themselves and Yusuf. “Are you our brother, Yusuf?”
 They asked him “I am Yusuf”
 He replied, “and Benyamin is my brother. Allah(swt) has been good to us Whoever fears Allah(swt)
and is patient, Allah(swt) always rewards them!” The brothers began to
tremble with fear, but Yusuf(as) comforted them. “We have sinned
brother” they said. “Allah(swt) has certainly
preferred you more than us” “May Allah(swt) forgive
you” said the Prophet. “He is the most Merciful
of the Merciful” The Prophet then embraced his
brothers, and wept with Joy. It was not possible for
him to leave Egypt as he had many responsibilities. So he advised his brothers
to leave without him. He then gave them his shirt and said  “Take this shirt of mine,and throw it over
my father’s face. He will recover his sight. Then bring me all
of your family” The brothers agreed,
and left for Caanan. As the caravan approached
Caanan, Yaqub (as) sensed the scent of
Yusuf in the air! He stood up all of a sudden, got dressed, and went
to meet his sons . “Yaqub has come out
of his room today!” The wife of his
eldest son remarked. “How do you feel today?”
asked the other “I can smell Yusuf in the air” 
replied the prophet. The wives then left him alone, saying that there
was no hope for him “He will die weeping
over Yusuf” said one “He said he could smell him! He has gone mad” 
said the other. That night the old man asked for a
glass of milk to break his fasting. As the Caravan
approached nearer, the old Prophet kept
praying to the Lord And when the Caravan
finally arrived, the old prophet went
outside and asked “I smell Yusuf in the air! Is
it real, or am I hallucinating? “You are certainly mistaken”
said one of the wives. But the prophet was
indeed telling the truth! The bearer of the
good news arrived, and placed Yusuf’s
shirt over his face! It was a miracle! As soon
as the shirt was placed, Yaqub (as) got his sight back!!! “Didn’t I tell you
that I know from Allah(swt) what you don’t know?”He
said to them happily The brothers realized
their mistake. “We have sinned father.
Please ask forgiveness for our actions” they said. “I will ask Lord to forgive you, He is All-Forgiving and
All-Merciful” replied the Prophet! Then the Old Prophet left
for Egypt to meet his son. Yusuf (as) received
him with great joy! Then Yusuf (as) placed his
father on the throne!! The old prophets happiness
knew no bounds. Then his father and
all his brothers prostrated before Yusuf (as) “This is the the dream that I saw when I 
was young"" said Yusuf (as) “I saw eleven stars,
the sun and the moon bowing down to me. My
Lord has made it true!” The prophet then met the king, seeking permission for his
family to settle down in Egypt. The prophet was a great
asset to the Kingdom, and the King was
very happy to agree. The great power and
responsibility did not distract the
Prophet from Allah (swt). He remembered and worshipped
Allah(swt) all the time. The prophet did not want to
die the death of a king. He did not like to
be gathered around the people of royalty.
He wanted to die the death of a slave
to Allah(swt), and to be gathered around the righteous. Yusuf (as), at the
time of his death, asked his brothers to bury
him beside his forefathers. So when he passed away,
he was mummified and placed in a coffin until a suitable
time to be taken out of Egypt. It is said that he died at the age of One hundred and ten!! Mashallah! That was
such a great story!! Now are you ready
for the questions? Yes I am!! Alright, now tell me
how did Prophet Yaqub (as) know that his son was coming? Yusuf(as) had given his
shirt to his brothers. When the caravan
they were travelling approached the house of Yaqub(as) he got the smell
of his shirt and realized that his lost
son was returning! Mashallah! That’s
the correct answer. Now tell me how did
Yaqub(as) regain his sight? Yaqub(as) regained his sight when his 
eyes were covered with the Yusuf’s shirt. That’s right again! And now
for the last question. Where did Prophet
Yusuf (AS) die? He died in Egypt, at the
age of one hundred and ten That’s brilliant my son.
That’s all for today, I will tell you the story of
another prophet tomorrow Good night my son Good night!"
"Assalamu Alaikum Walaikum Assalam Uncle, which story are you
going to tell me today?  Inshallah, I will tell you
the story of Imam ali Ibn Talib Please tell his story uncle Alright, Now listen carefully! The Story of Ali bin Talib
(Rali Allahu Anhu) Born to Abu Talib and Fatimah bint Asad, Ali was the only child believed
to have been born in the sacred sanctuary of the Kaaba, in Mecca,
the holiest place in Islam. Ali was the first young
male who accepted Islam. After migrating to Medina, he married Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu
alaihi wasallam)’s daughter Fatimah. Ali took part in the early caravan
raids from Mecca and later in almost all the battles fought
 by the nascent Muslim community. He was appointed caliph by the
 Prophes companions in 656 after Caliph Uthman ibn
Affan was assassinated. Now let us watch and learn the amazing
story of the first Imam in Islam.  Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) was
born in a very unique circumstance. He was born on the Friday, 13th of Rajab, 23 years before the first Hijra. Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) was almost 30 years old when Ali was born. Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) was
born inside the Holy Kaaba. His mother Fatima bint Asad was praying
 outside the Kaaba,  when suddenly she felt
intense pain of childbirth. She knelt to pray, and when she raised her head
 from prostration, the wall of the Holy Kaaba split as if to admit her inside!. Once she was inside, the walls of the
Kaaba returned to the normal position. Had it not been the will of Allah
 (Subhanahu wa ta'ala,) such a thing would have never happened. This crack is still present till this
date on the walls of Holy Kaaba. Many people saw this, including the uncle of Prophet-  Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib. They were outside the Kaaba when
the whole incident took place. They ran around and told people
about what had happened. The news spread like wildfire
 all over Makkah.  The keys of the Holy Kaaba
were brought to unlock the door,  but all efforts ended in failure. On the fourth day,
there was a miracle. The people who had gathered
 around Holy Kaaba  saw that the locks of the door
 breaking down on its own! To their surprise, they saw
 Fatima bint Asad walking out of the building holding a
 newborn baby in her arms! From a very young age, it was the Prophet
who fed him and took care of him. Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi
 wasallam) fondled him in his lap. He made Ali sleep by his side. The little one enjoyed the warmth
of the Holy Prophet and inhaled the holy fragrance
 of his breath. Amirul Momineen,
 Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib (Rali Allahu Anhu) was born three years before the marriage of Prophet
 Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) with Hazrat Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha). He lived along with his parents and
 brothers for six years, before the Prophet adopted him. Ali moved to the Prophet’s house because of the financial crisis
 his parent were facing. Ever since he was six years old, the young boy lived with the Prophet. It was at the Prophet’s house that
he spent his teen and adolescence. He witnessed all the happenings
in the Prophet’s life. Ali’s education was not a normal
one, like other children. He followed the Prophet like His shadow
everywhere and learned a lot from him. He followed the Prophet even during
the times of exclusive privacy. He witnessed the mental and spiritual developments
of the Prophet on top of Hira mountain. The Prophet used to stay on
the mountain for 3 or 4 days. Sometimes Ali carried his
food to the mountain. When Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)  and His wife first accepted Islam, Ali was the third person to follow Islam. Ali started acting as the Prophet’s
bodyguard even when he was just a boy. Young men from Quraish clan used
to throw stones at the Prophet. Ali could not bear this sight, and
he would attack the Quraishi men. He fought against those who were much
older than him, and he was often injured. After some days, he was
 nicknamed as Qaazim, which meant the breaker of the thrower. Nobody dared to throw anything at
the Prophet when Ali was with him. It was the night of Hijra. Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu
alaihi wasallam) informed Ali about his dangerous plan of
migrating to Medina. He asked Ali if he would sleep in his bed
in place of him to confuse the attackers. It was a dangerous situation. The walls of Prophet’s house was
hardly seven feet high and attackers could easily jump in. But when the Prophet asked him if he
 was willing to accept this danger,  Ali replied with another question. “If I sleep in your place, in your
bed, will your life be saved? The Prophet replied yes. Ali then thanked
 Allah (Subhanahu wa ta'ala,) and slept in the bed of Holy Prophet, covering himself with Prophet’s blanket
without any hesitation. It was because of Ali that Prophet was
 able to leave the house unnoticed. He left for Medina,
and by the time attackers realized this,Prophet
was far away from Makkah The Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi
 wasallam) had handed him the money which people of Makkah had entrusted. After three days of Prophet's departure,  Ali returned the money to their
respective owners He then set out to leave Makkah for
 Medinah along with the rest of his family. Even though the enemies tried to stop him,  he drove the infidels away and safely
arrived in Medina. The Prophet was waiting for
 him outside the city. When he saw Ali, he was overjoyed
 and embraced him. He welcomed Ali and the rest
of his family to Medinah. The Prophet created a bond of
brotherhood between Muslims. He declared that Ali
was his brother. Once the family settled in the newly
adopted city of Medina, their first task was to complete the mosque
 around which their houses were built. The Prophet, Ali and other Muslims in
Medina helped in building the mosque. Mashallah! That was such a great story. There are many other
stories of Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) But those I will tell you tomorrow. Good bye Abu. Good bye."
"Assalamu Alaikum Walaikum Assalam! Which story are you going
to tell me today uncle? Inshallah, I will tell you the story of the Prophet’s wife-
 Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha) Mashallah, that is amazing! Please tell me the story uncle! Yes Abu,  I will start now The Story of Khadija(Rali Allahu Anha) Bismillahirrahmanirrahim Khadija al-Kubra,daughter of
  Khuwaylid ibn Asad ibn Qusayy belonged to the clan of Banu Hashim of
the tribe Banu Asad. According to many sources, Khadija was born in 565 AD. And died eleven years after the
 Hijra which took place in 623 AD. Khadija grew up in Makkah
and she got married to a merchant called
Abu Hala ibn Zururah. They had two sons called
 Hind and Hala. Her husband didn’t live long, and he died after she gave
 birth to their sons. After the death of her husband, she got married to another merchant named
Atiq ibn Ayidh. They had a daughter and named her Hind. But this marriage too didn’t last for long. Her second husband passed away soon. Khadija(Rali Allahu Anha)
belonged to a rich family, and she inherited the wealth of
 her husbands as well. She performed good deeds with her wealth. She was not only wise, but she was
very good in conducting business. She started handling their
families trading business herself. She would buy goods and do business
with traders in Yemen and Syria. Since she was a woman,
she couldn’t travel to these distant lands. She hired people to do this job for her. People from faraway lands travelled to
Yemen through Makkah. Many of these travellers took halt in
Makkah for food and rest. They use to set up temporary
 shops in the market and trade their goods with other merchants. One day Abu Talib, the uncle of Prophet
 Muhammad(Sallallaho Alaihe Wassalam) was sitting in the market. He overheard two men
discussing about Khadija. They talked to each other about
the news of Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha) looking for a new man
to assist her in business. It was a well known fact that Khadija paid her men
more than anyone else. Abu Talib who overheard this,
thought about his nephew. He wanted the young Prophet
to learn business so that he could look after himself. Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam)  had grown into a young man by now. He was liked by everyone for
his good character and wisdom that he received the title ‘Al Ameen’ which meant the faithful. Abu Talib met the Prophet and asked
him to meet Khadija for the job. The Prophet didn’t want to be burden
on his uncle’s family who were already struggling. So he agreed to meet Khadija for the Job. Abu Talib really wanted
his nephew to get the job, so he decided to meet
Khadija himself first. He went to her house,
introduced himself and said “My nephew is called Al Ameen
by people in Makkah. He is looking for a job. I heard you are hiring someone
for your caravan.  It would be great if you can hire him” Khadija knew Abu Talib and she had heard
 good things about the young prophet. “I have heard about your nephew. I would be happy to hire him. Ask him to come and meet me tomorrow.” The Prophet met Khadija(Rali Allahu Anha) and she immediately hired him. She made him in charge of her
trade caravan to Syria. Prophet was very happy to work for her. He was only twenty five years old,
and full of energy. He was confident of doing
good business for his master. This was not the first time that
the prophet was travelling to Syria, He had been there once with
his uncle Abu Talib. He was just twelve years old then, and he had been their to sell
some of his uncle’s merchandise. But things were different now. He was made in charge of the whole team. He knew that he had to take
 good care of the merchandise, and use his skills to make good profit. Khadija knew that Prophet was young, and there were chances that people would
take advantage of his inexperience. To aid him, she sent her trusted servant
 Maysarah along with him The journey from Makkah to Syria
took several days to complete, and tested the strongest men. At first they travelled under the
scorching sun through the desert. Once they crossed the desert, they now had 
to travel throught forests for many days. And after many days of travel,
they finally reached Syria. The market in Syria was much
bigger than the one in Makkah. There were traders everywhere. The place had changed much
since the Prophets last visit. Maysarah soon found a spot
for their camels under a tree. They tied their camels, unpacked their
 goods and put them up for display. Soon they were surrounded by
curious merchants who came to see what they are selling. Prophet and Maysarah sold
all their goods in no time!  The prophet had bargained for
the best price for all his merchandise. Once they had enough money with them, Prophet decided to take a
walk in the market. He was amazed at the quality of goods
they were selling in the market.  People came from all over Turkey, China, India and many
other places to sell their goods.  He knew that these goods would get
excellent price if taken back to Makkah. The Prophet talked to the traders and got
 excellent price for the goods they sold. They loaded their caravans with
goods and left from Syria. They had made good profits, and they
also had many goods. that would get excellent
profit in the markets of Makkah The people of Makkah were amazed
to see the caravan loaded with goods. They wondered what were in those bags. The prophet handed over all the money
 he had made by selling her goods in Syria He also handed over all the goods
he had brought from there. Khadija was surprised. Prophet had made double the profits
than anyone before him! He had also brought many
merchandise as well! She knew that this was all because
of his excellent character. When the Prophet left,
she called Maysarah . and asked him how the Prophet behaved He praised the Prophet. “I have never seen anybody more honest
or more trustworthy than Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) Khadija gave prophet additional
 responsibilities and he performed those much to her satisfaction. As days went by she was more and more
 impressed by the Prophet’s character Mashallah, that was such a great story. I'm glad you liked it my son. Are there any more stories of
Beevi Fathima (Rali Allahu Anha) uncle? Yes, my son. There many other interesting stories. I'll tell you those later. It is time for me to leave. Good bye! Good bye!"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! Did you finish your
homework my son? Yes, I did! Now please
tell me the story Baba Alright my son! Now do you remember
where we stopped yesterday? You told me how Talut planned
to kill the Prophet. But Miqel overheard their plans, and warned the Prophet. So he escaped on a camel
during the night. Mashaallah!
 That was great. I will tell you the remaining
story now, listen carefully! Bismillah! Prophet Dawud (as)
becomes the King! Dawud (as) realized that Talut was
going to kill him that night. So he gathered his
belongings and some food, and escaped from the palace He travelled for a long time. Then he found a cave
on top of a mountain. He decided that this was a
good place to get some rest. The Prophet stayed
there for many days. The Prophet’s brothers realized
that he was hiding inside the cave, and they came to meet him “We are tired of our King”
they told the Prophet. “He is ill treating
everyone in the kingdom” “We want to join forces
with you brother” The next day, few citizens
arrived at the cave “What do you want?”
asked the Prophet “Please save us from our king” 
said the citizens. “He is an evil man, and
he is torturing everyone. Please let us join your army The Prophet agreed Like that more and more citizens
arrived to join the Prophet’s army. Talut ill treated his subjects, and 
terrorized his soldiers. The citizens had slowly
started to turn against him! When he realized that the Prophet was
 assembling an army, he decided to go to war
against the Prophet. The army marched for many days, and they
had covered a great distance by now. The King and his men were tired, so they decided to rest for
some time at the valley. When Talut was sleeping, the Prophet
crept into his cave silently. He took his sword and cut off
a piece of Talut’s garment. He went outside and
shouted “OH KING” The king woke up and
went outside the cave. He saw the prophet
standing with his men. “You came here
seeking to kill me” “But I do not hate you, and
I don’t want to kill you” “If I wanted to kill you, then I could
have done that while you were asleep. Then the Prophet showed
him the piece of cloth, and told him “here is
piece of your garment. I could have killed you
instead, but I did not. My mission is that
of love, not malice” The King realized his mistake
and begged for forgiveness. The Prophet forgave the King, and he
was allowed to go back to his kingdom. After a few years, Talut got
killed in another battle. The people remembered what
Dawud (as) had done for them, so they elected him
as their king. Allah(swt) made his Kingdom strong and
great, and his enemies feared him. After sometime, the Prophet was a blessed
with a son, and he named him Sulaiman. The boy was very intelligent
and wise from childhood. He was eleven years old, when the
following incident took place. One day, Dawud (as) was as usual,
solving problems of his people. Then two men came to him,
one of them owned a field. The owner of the field said “O dear Prophet! This man’s sheep came to
my field last night, and ate all my grapes” “I am left with nothing now, please ask
him to compensate for my loss!” He cried “Is this true?” the Prophet
asked the owner of the sheep “Yes sir” He replied. The Prophet then thought
for a while, and said “I have decided that you give him
your sheep in exchange for his loss” “But sir, the sheep is all I have” 
said the man! That’s when Sulaiman spoke up. “I have another solution” “What is it?” asked the Prophet Then his son said “let the owner
of the sheep work at the field, until the grapes
grow back again. And let the owner of the field keep
 the sheep till then. The field owner can make a living by 
using the wool and the milk, until his crops grow back. And when the grapes are ready, the
field owner can take back his field, and return the sheep
to its owner!” The Prophet was surprised “This is a sound judgement!” “Praise be to Allah(swt) for blessing you
with wisdom. You are truly wise!” The men thanked Sulaiman as it was because
of him that they got a fair judgement. The owner of the sheep was also happy as
he didn’t have to give away his sheep Allah(swt) had truly blessed Sulaiman
 with wisdom in addition to what he had inherited 
from his father. Prophet Dawud (as) was a just 
and righteous ruler who brought peace and prosperity
 to his people. Allah(swt) had also honored
him as a messenger. He delivered Allah’s message to his people,
with the help of his melodious voice. When he recited the Zaboor, the people
listened to him as if in a trance. The messages he delivered are
very famous and well remembered. Even though he was the King,
he did not live lavishly. He didn’t use the money from the 
treasury for himself. He was experienced in the craft
 of weapon making, so he made and sold
weapons himself. The Prophet lived on
this meagre income. The Prophet divided his
working day into four parts. One to earn a living and to rest,  one to pray to his Lord,  one to attend his people, and the last part to
deliver his sermons. One day, the prophet was as usual 
praying in his room.  He ordered the guards not to allow
 anyone to interrupt him. But somehow two men managed
to enter the room. When the Prophet’s prayer was
disturbed, he asked them angrily “Who are you?” “Do not be frightened”
said one of them “We have a dispute among ourselves,
and we are here for your judgement” “What is it” asked the Prophet Then the first man said
“this is my brother. He has ninety nine ewes,
and I have only one. One day he said “Hand it over to me,
and overpowered me with his speech” He has wronged me
by taking my sheep. Please tell me your judgement The Prophet didn’t wait to listen to
what the other person had to say, and said in a hurry
“He has wronged you. It was wrong of him to demand your
sheep, inspite of him having so many” Then suddenly, the two men
vanished like a cloud! It was then that the Prophet realized
that they were the angels sent by God. They were here to
teach him a lesson! He realized that he should not have passed
 the judgement before hearing from the opposing party He realized his mistake, and fell
on the ground seeking repentance. He sought forgiveness from
his Lord, and cried bitterly Allah(swt) forgave him, and the
Prophet lived for a long time. The Prophet worshipped Allah(swt), and
sang his praises until he died. According to traditions,  his death was mourned by four thousand 
Priests and thousands of people. During the day of burial, the sun was so hot, and the people who had arrived
were having a hard time. It was then Sulaiman
called the birds Thousands of birds arrived, and
they flew up and covered the sun!! This was the first sign of dominion
 by Sulaiman(as)  that was witnessed by the people!! Birds covering the sun!! Masha allah, that was amazing!! So did you like the story? I loved it Baba! Alright, now are you
ready for the questions? Yes I am So tell me why the people started
taking the side of the Prophet? The people were tired of Talut
 ill treating them. That’s why they joined the Prophet That’s correct Now tell me if the Prophet killed
Talut when he was sleeping? No.. The Prophet cut off a piece of Talut’s
garment, and he took the spear as well Why did he do that? The Prophet wanted to show Talut
that he didn’t want to kill anyone, even when he had the chance. That’s very good. Now tell me the
occupation of Prophet Dawud (as) He was a weapon maker That’s right again. The Prophet divided his
day into four parts- How did the Prophet
divide his day? The Prophet divided his
day into four parts- The first was for him to
earn a living and to rest. During the second part,
he prayed to his Lord. The third part was used for listening to
his people, and to settle their disputes. He used the last part for
delivering his sermons Masha Allah, that was
excellent my son! Now for the last question, What was the name of
the Prophet’s son? It was Sulaiman!! That’s wonderful. That’s all for today, I will tell you the story of Prophet
Sulaiman tomorrow! Good night Amir! Good night Baba!"
"Assalamu Alaikum Walaikum Asslam Uncle, which story are you
 going to tell me today? Inshallah, I will tell you the
story of Imam Ali Ibn Talib Please tell his story uncle Alright, now listen carefully. Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu)was married
 to Hazrat Fatima (Rali Allahu Anha), the daughter of Prophet
Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). It was a very happy marriage. Their characters blended so well that they never quarrelled and
 complained of one another. They led a happy
and conded life. Each one of them was rich in
their own rights. Fatima was the only heir to the
 richest woman of Arabia, and she had inherited many orchards
and gardens in Makkah and Medinah. She was also the daughter of the
most respected person in Makkah. Ali had become the
marshal as well. Yet they gave away all that they owned
to the poor and the orphans in the town. They had to starve
themselves often. Their only luxury in life was the
prayers and the company of each other. They were given a girl to help them
in household chores, Bibi Fizza. But the Prophet had made
 arrangements in such a way that the girl only had to attend her
duties every alternate day. Bibi Fizza was not allowed to
 attend to her duties even when Fatima was ill during off day. But Ali would do the household
chores on such days  and would attend to her needs. He grinded the oats, lighted the oven, prepared bread and
  looked after the children. The battles of Badr, Ohud, Khadaq and
Khyber were fought in the defense of Islam and won by the hands of
Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu). along with other Sahabahs. He was not only the standard bearer
of the flag in those battles,  but always led the forces of
 Islam and came victorious. Even though he was the strongest
 and the bravest man in town, he used to go shopping and carry home
 the goods himself. When people saw him, they used to hurry
to him to help carry the burden. But he would deny them all and tell them “It is more fitting for a family head  carry his own burden” Such was his humilility that Hazrat Salman al Farsi (Rali
Allahu Anhu) once saw him and said. “What a household! The daughter of the Holy Prophet and his wife is leading the life
of a poor labourer. If they had saved one tenth of what
they are distributing daily, they would have led a life of
 ease and comfort” Fatima gave birth to four children. She died during the
 birth of her fifth child. Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) never 
married any other woman while his wife Fatima was alive. After her death he married Yamamah, and after her death another
woman named Hanafia. Ali was also known for
his generosity. Like the Prophet, he too liked to lead a
simple life, and he gave away all the rest. One day, he was returning home with a
string of camels, fully laden with goods. On the way, a beggar asked
Ali for a piece of bread. Ali ordered his beloved servant Qambar
to give some bread to the beggar. Qambar started searching
for the bread. He had forgotten in where
he had packed the bread. After a few moments, Ali asked
Qambar why there was a delay. Qambar replied that he was
still searching for the bread. Amir al Miminin Hazrat Ali
 (Rali Allahu Anhu) said “Give the beggar the camel which
carries the bread.” Qambar was now running
between the camels After a while Ali
inquired about the delay. Qambar replied “I am searching for
the camel carrying the food.” Ali was getting angry. He then ordered Qambar to give
the whole caravan to the beggar. Qambar hurriedly jumped off from the camel and handed the reins of 
caravan to the fortunate beggar. Ali was surprised at how quickly
Qambar had handed over the caravan. So he asked him why he handed
over the caravan in such a haste? Qambar replied “Master, you are in such a mood that on
account of a small delay, you gave away the whole caravan. I was afraid that if there was some
delay in handing over the caravan, you might have given me away also
with the caravan. You will get a thousand slaves like me, but where will I get a master like you? There are many other stories
that showed his generosity. On another day, Ali went to the
market with his servant Qambar. He bought two shirts from the market,  one which was really nice and expensive, and the other which was not as good. When they returned home,
 he gave the good shirt to Qambar and kept the poor one for himself. Qambar asked his master to keep
 the good one for himself as he was the leader of the Muslims. He said that he could wear the
poor one as he was just a servant. Ali answered that Qambar should
wear the nicer shirt because he was younger
and it would suit him better. But more importantly, Ali told him that he
 was a guide for Muslims and he had to set a good example
 before them by leading a simple life. One day, two men met outside the city. One was a Muslim, and the other
belonged to some other religion. The Muslim man was going to Kufa, the capital and the center
of Islamic Government. Other gentleman was headed to
 another place nearby Since a part of their journey 
was through a common route, they decided to travel together. On the way they talked about
various topics of mutual interest. They finally arrived at the point
where their paths separated. The Muslim started walking along
with his Non Muslim companion. The man was surprised and asked the Muslim “Didn’t you say you were going to Kufa?” “Yes” said the Muslim “Then why are you
coming this way?. The other road
takes you to Kufa” “I know.  I want to walk a few
steps with you to see you off. As our Prophet has said “Whenever two persons travel together
 on the same path,  they establish reciprocal right upon
each other”. ” Now you have got a right upon me and for the sake of that right  I wish to walk a few steps with you. And then I shall return
to my own route.” The Non muslim was really impressed “I now know why your religion is
spreading so fast in this world. It is because of such noble practices your
religion preach in such a perfect way! It is all because your Prophet
 Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)” The surprise and admiration
of this non-Muslim friend reached its peak when he learned
that his Muslim friend was Amir Al Muminin, Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu),
the Caliph of that time. This man soon embraced Islam and was counted as one of the trusted
companion of Hazrat Ali(Rali Allahu Anhu) Mashallah, that was
such a great story! There are many other stories
of Ali(Rali Allahu Anhu) but those I’ll tell you tomorrow. Good bye Abu Good bye!"
"Assalamu-Alaikum! Walaikum As-salam! Are you ready for today’s story? Yes Baba! I’m going to tell you the story of
 Prophet Yusuf (as) today! Prophet Yusuf (as)? Yes my son The story of prophet Yusuf (as) is the most detailed and fascinating 
stories in the Quran. Now listen carefully. The Dream of Prophet Yusuf (as) Prophet Yusuf (as) was the son of
 Prophet Yaqub (as) and Rahel. He had a younger brother named 
Benyamin from his mother. Yaqub (as) had twelve sons in total. Prophet Yaqub (as) loved Yusuf (as)  and Benyamin more than
 his other children. This made the other brothers 
very angry. One night Yusuf (as) had a
 wonderful dream! He saw eleven stars in the sky,
and the sun and the moon, they were all bowing 
down before him! The young prophet was quite
 amazed by this dream! He wondered why stars bowed
 before  him. He didn’t understand the meaning, so he went to his father,
and told him about his dream “Father, I saw eleven stars, the sun
 and the moon in a dream!” He told his father. “I saw all of them bowing down to me!” Yaqub (as) was a prophet, and he understood the
 meaning of his dream, and he was very happy! “Allah (swt) has blessed you Yusuf” 
The old prophet told his son. This dream means that you will be
 given knowledge and prophecy!” Yaqub (as) was a wise and old man, so he knew that his other sons would not be
 happy to hear about Yusuf’s dream. So he warned him “My son, do not tell any of your
 brothers about your dream. They will be jealous of you, and
 they will become your enemies. “No father, I will not tell them” 
replied his son. But the young and innocent boy went and told his brothers about the dream. When the brothers heard about this,
they got really angry. “Why does our father love Yusuf
 more than us?” asked one of the brothers “Maybe its because he is so beautiful”
 replied another brother “Our father has gone astray” 
said another “Why don’t we kill Yusuf, and get rid
 of him?” asked another brother “Where would we kill him?” 
asked the other “We should send him away to a distant land”
 said another brother Then one of the brother said “There is no need to kill him
 to get rid of him. Look here, let us throw him into
 a well beside the road. He will be picked up by the travelers, 
and they will take him as a slave to a distant land. He will disappear from 
our father's eyes, and that will serve our
 purpose as well. Then the ten brothers went 
to their father, and requested him to send Yusuf(as)
 along with them. But Yaqub (as) was very afraid
 for Yusuf(as). He knew that the brothers were
 jealous of him, and that they did not love him. He refused at first. “Yusuf is our dear little brother” 
said one of them. We are the sons of the same father, so what are you afraid of?” “Please send him with us”
 said another brother “We will watch over him” “I fear the wolf may take him while
 you are playing” said Yaqub (as) “Never” replied a brother. “How can the wolf eat him 
when we are there, we are strong and we can 
save him father” After a lot of compulsion 
from the brothers,  the prophet gave them permission to take
Yusuf(as) along with them. The next day, the brothers took Yusuf (as) 
with them to the forest. They were very excited as they
 could finally get rid of him! They walked through the forest and 
went directly to the well, as they had planned They leaned over the well on the
 pretext of drinking water. It was then that one of the brothers put
 his arms around Yusuf (as) and held him tightly. Startled by this unusual behaviour, Yusuf(as) struggled to free himself! Then all the brothers joined,
 and held him so that he couldn’t move. Then one of them removed his shirt. Together they lifted Yusuf (as) and 
threw him into the deep well!! Yusuf (as) cried for help, and he begged 
his brothers to save him. But the brothers shook their heads and paid no heed to the pleas 
of their brother. Yusuf (as) was all alone in the
 deep dark well. He was very scared
 and he wept. It was then that Allah(swt) told him “Do not be sad, 
do not be afraid. Allah is with you. Something great is going to
 happen to you . Your brothers will come before you and you
 will remind them of what they did. Yusuf (as) was saved by the
 shallow water. He then clung to a rock ledge, 
and climbed on top of it. The brothers then got together and said “what shall we tell our father?” Then one of them said “We will tell him,
 You were right father, a wolf did eat him!” “Yes” the brothers agreed. “We will tell our father that
 the wolf ate him” The brothers then caught a 
ram and killed it. Then they took Yusuf (as)'s shirt and 
dipped it in the blood. “now our father will believe us” 
they said. The brothers came weeping 
to their father. “Father” they said “We went running races, and left
 Yusuf with our bags. But by the time we returned,
 a wolf ate our little brother!” “Yes father” said another 
“Look at his shirt” But Yaqub (as) knew that 
they were lying.  He was a prophet and a 
very wise man. He knew that when a wolf eats someone,
it rips his clothes. But the shirt of Yusuf (as) was whole, and it had been only dipped in blood. That’s how the prophet knew that the 
story of the wolf was made up! “This is a story that you have made up”
 he said to them. “I am a patient man and
 I will wait for my son” Yaqub (as) couldn’t sleep that night
 and kept thinking about his son. It was a terrible time for Yusuf (as),
 in that deep well, out in the wilderness, 
hidden in darkness. It was a difficult time for both the
 father and the son. A group of people were travelling to
 Egypt through that wilderness. They were thirsty and 
looking for water. When they saw the well, they sent a man
 to bring them some water. The man came to the well and
 let down a bucket. Yusuf (as) was happy when he saw the
 bucket coming down,  and he grabbed hold of it. As the man began to haul,  he felt the load was 
unusually heavy! When he peeped into the well, he was shocked to see a young man
 clinging to the rope! He held the rope tightly, and shouted to his friends “Better give me hand fellows, looks like I found real treasure
 in the well!” His companions rushed to the well, to pull the stranger holding
 onto the rope! The men were startled when they saw 
the handsome youth, beaming with an angelic smile! They knew that they would get a handsome
 price for this young man, and money was all that 
mattered to them. They immediately chained Yusuf (as),
 and took him to Egypt, far away from his home Masha Allah! That was such a great story!! I’m glad you liked it They took him to Egypt, but I will tell 
you that story tomorrow! Alright! Now are you ready for
 the questions? Yes, I am! Now tell me who was the mother of
 Prophet Yusuf (as) His mother was Rahel! That’s correct. Can you tell me about the dream that
 the Prophet saw? In his dream, the Prophet saw eleven stars
 in the sky, and the sun and the moon, and they all bowed down before him! That’s wonderful! Now tell me how the brothers got rid
 of the Prophet The brothers of Prophet Yusuf (as)
 was jealous of him. One day, they lied to their father, and took the Prophet
 along with them. They dumped him in a well, 
after removing his clothes And what happened after that? They dipped his clothes in blood, and showed it to their father, telling him that the wolves ate him! Masha Allah!
That’s the right answer! Now, for the last question. Tell me how was the Prophet
 saved from the well A group a travelers came to the well to 
get water, and they found him! Excellent! That’s the
 right answer! That’s all for today, I will tell you the
 remaining story tomorrow! Good night my son! Good night Baba!"
"Assalamu Alaikum Walaikum Assalam! Which story are you going
to tell me today uncle? Inshallah, I will tell you the story of the Prophet’s wife-
 Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha) Mashallah, that is amazing! Please tell me the story uncle! Yes Abu,  I will start now The Story of Khadija(Rali Allahu Anha) Bismillahirrahmanirrahim Khadija al-Kubra,daughter of
  Khuwaylid ibn Asad ibn Qusayy belonged to the clan of Banu Hashim of
the tribe Banu Asad. According to many sources, Khadija was born in 565 AD. And died eleven years after the
 Hijra which took place in 623 AD. Khadija grew up in Makkah
and she got married to a merchant called
Abu Hala ibn Zururah. They had two sons called
 Hind and Hala. Her husband didn’t live long, and he died after she gave
 birth to their sons. After the death of her husband, she got married to another merchant named
Atiq ibn Ayidh. They had a daughter and named her Hind. But this marriage too didn’t last for long. Her second husband passed away soon. Khadija(Rali Allahu Anha)
belonged to a rich family, and she inherited the wealth of
 her husbands as well. She performed good deeds with her wealth. She was not only wise, but she was
very good in conducting business. She started handling their
families trading business herself. She would buy goods and do business
with traders in Yemen and Syria. Since she was a woman,
she couldn’t travel to these distant lands. She hired people to do this job for her. People from faraway lands travelled to
Yemen through Makkah. Many of these travellers took halt in
Makkah for food and rest. They use to set up temporary
 shops in the market and trade their goods with
 other merchants. One day Abu Talib, the uncle of Prophet
 Muhammad(Sallallaho Alaihe Wassalam) was sitting in the market. He overheard two men
discussing about Khadija. They talked to each other about
the news of Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha) looking for a new man
to assist her in business. It was a well known fact that Khadija paid her men
more than anyone else. Abu Talib who overheard this,
thought about his nephew. He wanted the young Prophet
to learn business so that he could look after himself. Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam)  had grown into a young man by now. He was liked by everyone for
his good character and wisdom that he received the title ‘Al Ameen’ which meant the faithful. Abu Talib met the Prophet and asked
him to meet Khadija for the job. The Prophet didn’t want to be burden
on his uncle’s family who were already struggling. So he agreed to meet Khadija for the Job. Abu Talib really wanted
his nephew to get the job, so he decided to meet
Khadija himself first. He went to her house,
introduced himself and said “My nephew is called Al Ameen
by people in Makkah. He is looking for a job. I heard you are hiring someone
for your caravan.  It would be great if you can hire him” Khadija knew Abu Talib and she had heard
 good things about the young prophet. “I have heard about your nephew. I would be happy to hire him. Ask him to come and meet me tomorrow.” The Prophet met Khadija(Rali Allahu Anha) and she immediately hired him. She made him in charge of her
trade caravan to Syria. Prophet was very happy to work for her. He was only twenty five years old,
and full of energy. He was confident of doing
good business for his master. This was not the first time that
the prophet was travelling to Syria, He had been there once with
his uncle Abu Talib. He was just twelve years old then, and he had been their to sell
some of his uncle’s merchandise. But things were different now. He was made in charge of the whole team. He knew that he had to take
 good care of the merchandise, and use his skills to make good profit. Khadija knew that Prophet was young, and there were chances that people would
take advantage of his inexperience. To aid him, she sent her trusted servant
 Maysarah along with him The journey from Makkah to Syria
took several days to complete, and tested the strongest men. At first they travelled under the
scorching sun through the desert. Once they crossed the desert, they now had
to travel throught forests for many days. And after many days of travel,
they finally reached Syria. The market in Syria was much
bigger than the one in Makkah. There were traders everywhere. The place had changed much
since the Prophets last visit. Maysarah soon found a spot
for their camels under a tree. They tied their camels, unpacked their
 goods and put them up for display. Soon they were surrounded by
curious merchants who came to see what they are selling. Prophet and Maysarah sold
all their goods in no time!  The prophet had bargained for
the best price for all his merchandise. Once they had enough money with them, Prophet decided to take a
walk in the market. He was amazed at the quality of goods
they were selling in the market.  People came from all over Turkey, China, India and many
other places to sell their goods.  He knew that these goods would get
excellent price if taken back to Makkah. The Prophet talked to the traders and got
 excellent price for the goods they sold. They loaded their caravans with
goods and left from Syria. They had made good profits, and they
also had many goods. that would get excellent
profit in the markets of Makkah The people of Makkah were amazed
to see the caravan loaded with goods. They wondered what were in those bags. The prophet handed over all the money
 he had made by selling her goods in Syria He also handed over all the goods
he had brought from there. Khadija was surprised. Prophet had made double the profits
than anyone before him! He had also brought many
merchandise as well! She knew that this was all because
of his excellent character. When the Prophet left,
she called Maysarah . and asked him how the Prophet behaved He praised the Prophet. “I have never seen anybody more honest
or more trustworthy than Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) Khadija gave prophet additional
 responsibilities and he performed those much to her satisfaction. As days went by she was more and more
 impressed by the Prophet’s character One day,Khadija(Rali Allahu Anha)
was talking to Her friend  ""I have never met such a good man. This is for the first time that I have
mad so much profits, and its all because of Him. I think I am very lucky to have
hired the nephew of Abu Talib”. Her friend agreed with Her “Yes, you are very lucky!” “I think you should marry Him. He is good man, and you are a widow. You like Him so much too!” It was then that Khadija
(Rali Allahu Anha) thought about this. “Yes you are right. It is a good idea. Can you ask Him if He is willing
to marry me?” The next day, Khadija’s friend
met the Prophet. “Why are you not yet married?” she asked Him straight away! “I don’t have the means for
 supporting a family” the Prophet replied truthfully. “What if you are let off from
 taking that responsibility?” she asked Him. “How is that possible?”
asked the Prophet “What do you think of Khadija?” she asked “I hold her in great esteem. She is a wise, pious and a kind woman.”
 He replied “What if she would like to marry you?”
she asked Him. The prophet was surprised! He respected Khadija a lot
for giving Him work,  but the thought of marriage
never occurred to him. “I will give you an answer after talking to my uncle.”
He said. When the Prophet told his uncle
about the proposal, Abu Talib was very happy! He knew that Khadija was a good woman, and he was so happy for his nephew. The Prophet informed his uncle’s
approval to Khadija(Rali Allahu Anha) and they got married to each other
very soon! For the first few days,Prophet
 and Khadija(Rali Allahu Anha)  lived at Abu Talib’s house. Soon they shifted to a very large house. The Prophet and Khadija
 lived together in their new house happily. Khadija handed over all her
business to her husband. Prophet used her wealth wisely, and soon he became one of the
richest man in Makkah. Khadija(Rali Allahu Anha)
gave birth to six children two boys and four girls. However both the boys died
when they were still infants. They named the daughters- Zaynab,Ruqayya, Umm Kulthum and Fatima. They grew up into
young and beautiful girls. Years went by. But there were many questions that kept
arising in His mind every now and then. He often went on top of Mount Hira,from
where He could see the whole Makkah. Most of his doubts were the same as
what Prophet Ibrahim(Alaihissalam). He wondered who created this world, and how the humans were created. He thought about his purpose in this world. He wondered what would happen once He died. He gazed at the stars and kept thinking
about these questions. He loved spending more and more time alone
at Mount Hira. Khadija would often send Fatima,  their youngest daughter with
food and water to him. It was during one of these nights
when no one was near him, that an angel appeared before Him!! Prophet was amazed by
the sight of this angel! He couldn’t believe His eyes!! The Angel then asked the Prophet to read! But how could the Prophet read, when He had never gone to a school? “I am not a reader” He said to the angel. Then suddenly, the angel took hold of Him, and squeezed Him tightly! The angel said again  “Read” “I am not a reader"" The Prophet cried again! The angel then squeezed
the Prophet so hard, that He thought that He would faint! And he said “Read! In the Name of Your
Lord and cherisher, who created man,out of  a clot
of congealed blood. Read! And your Lord who is the most Generous, Who has taught writing by the pen- taught man which he knew not” The Prophet repeated the words
 with a trembling heart! Perplexed by His experience, Prophet made His way to home. As soon as He entered His house,  He said to His wife “Wrap me up!  Wrap me up!” He was trembling as He was He said this, and She wrapped Him up in a towel,  until His fear was gone. He explained to his wife
what had happened. When He finished,He asked Her if She
She thought He had gone mad! “Allah forbid!” She replied “He will surely not let such a
thing happen, for you speak the truth, you are faithful in trust,
you assist your fellow men” Then She went to Her cousin
Warawa Ibn Naufal, who was old and blind. But He knew the scriptures
 quite well, he had translated them into Arabic. When She told him about what happened
 to Her Husband,he cried out. “Holy! Holy! This is the Holy Spirit
that came to Musa! He will be the Prophet for His people! Tell Him this and ask Him
to be brave at heart! The Prophet continued to receive
revelations for the remainder of His life. It was memorized and written
down by His companions on sheepskins Slowly Prophet started understanding
the meanings of revelations. He realized that He was now responsible
 for spreading the message of Quran. Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) had been married to
Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha)  for 15 long years by now. She was the first person to accept Islam. She knew that her husband would speak only the truth, and she trusted him. One day angel Jibril(Alaihissalam) taught the Prophet how to
perform the wudu. The he taught the prophet
how to say the salah. When the Prophet learned this, he taught this to
Khadija(Rali Allahu Anha) as well. From that day, they started to pray
in their own house. Ali Ibn Abu Talib, the cousin of Prophet
Muhammad (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) was staying at their house and he saw them praying together. He was only 10 years old,  and he was curious to know
what they were doing When he asked, the Prophet told him that they were
 offering their prayers, or salah.  The prophet Muhammad
(Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) told the boy that Allah (Subhanahu wa ta'aala)
had made him a Prophet and revealed the Quran to him. The next day, Ali met the prophet and said ""‘I want to accept islam and
 follow its teachings” Prophet accepted this request gladly. Thus Ali became the second
follower of Islam after Khadija. They continued to pray together
from that day onwards.  The Prophet led the prayers and
Ali would stand next to Him. Khadija stood behind them Many days passed by,  and one day the angel
appeared again to the Prophet. The angel informed that it was
now time to call the people to Islam. He asked the prophet to preach the
message of Islam to the people. It was the dawn of a new era. The Prophet started
 calling people to Islam. He gave his full time attention in
preaching people about Islam. Preaching Islam was not an easy job.  But Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha)
supported her husband whole heartedly. She gave up her entire fortune
for the good cause of Islam. She got quite involved in her
 husband's work as well. She met people and talked
to them about Islam. Slowly and steadily people realized
that the Prophet was speaking the truth.  They started joining Islam one by one. But not everyone liked
what they were hearing, especially the Quraysh men. The Quraysh tribe were mainly
the leaders of Makkah. Most of the rich men in Makkah
belonged to the Quraysh tribe. They were scared that if people
started following Islam, then would no longer
 be feared and respected. They started treating the prophet
and his followers very cruelly.  They threw garbage at the prophet
whenever he passed by,  started beating those who
 was following the prophet,  and even chased some of
them out of Makkah. Several kinds of ban were
imposed on the Muslims. They were not allowed to take
part in their gatherings, and refused to do business with them. One day the prophet was sitting
on top of Hira mountain. He had been sitting there
for a long time now. When he did not reach
home at his usual time, Khadija started to worry about him. She asked one of the men to
 go and look for him in Makkah But after a while, the man returned. He couldn’t find the prophet
anywhere in Makkah. Khadija waited for some more time, but the prophet didn’t return. She decided to go and search
for the prophet herself. She carried some food and water with her. The Prophet had been in the
company of Angel Jibril(Alaihissalam) The angel said to the prophet  “Your wife is on her way here. She has got food and water for you.  When she arrives, tell her that there will be a house
made of pearls for her in paradise.” Like the Angel said, Khadija soon reached the cave. The prophet saw that she was carrying
food and water with her! Then the prophet told her about
 the angel’s message Khadija calmly replied  “May Gods peace and blessings
be upon you, Rasulullah” The Prophet had started
gaining many more followers.  When the Quraysh leaders saw this,
they were very angry. They imposed social boycott on
the Prophet and his family. Abu Lahab, the uncle of the Prophet,
was also the leader of Quraysh in Makkah. He was a very evil man,
 and the worst enemy of Muslims. He ordered a complete ban on the
Prophet’s family and their followers. No one in Makkah was allowed to
 buy or sell anything to them. They were not even allowed to talk to them. It was very difficult in those
days for someone  to live without the support
of their tribe. For three long years, the Prophet labored
quietly to deliver the message of God. Idol worship was deeply rooted
among the people,  and the Prophet tried to
 convince as much as He could After three years of struggle, He was only able to
secure thirty followers! Even His companions had now
started questioning His sanity! By now His enemies had started
 plotting against the Prophet The Prophet preached that everyone
were equal in front of God, and this challenged the
authority of local priests! One day, they gathered together and decided to suppress the movement of Prophet. They decided that each family
should take upon themselves the task of stamping out the
 followers of Islam. Each household started
torturing its own members,  relatives and slaves who were
following the Prophet. The people were beaten, flogged and
then thrown into the prison The hill of Ramada and the
 place called Bata had now become scenes of cruel torture. Only the Prophet was left out, because He had the protection of
Abu Talib and Abu Bakr (Rali Allahu Anhu) Then the priests tried to tempt the
Prophet into joining their religion.  For this, they sent Utba Ibn Rabi’a
to meet the Prophet “O son of my brother” said the messenger  “You are distinguished by your qualities. Yet, you have denounced our Gods.  I am here to make a proposition to you” “I am listening to you, O son of Walid”
said the Prophet. “If you are willing to acquire
 riches, honors, dignity, then we are willing to offer you a fortune larger than what we have among ourselves. We shall make you our chief,  and we will consult everything with you.  If you desire dominion,
then we shall make you our king” said Utba When Utba had finished, the Prophet said  “Now listen to me Son of Walid” “I’m listening” replied Utba The Prophet recited the first thirteen
 verses of Surah Fussilat He praised Allah (Subhanahu wa ta'ala), and explained about the
glad tidings of paradise to anyone who believed in the one true god. The Prophet then reminded him about what had happened to the
people of ‘Ad and Thamud When the Prophet had finished
His recitation, he said to Utba “This is my reply to your proposition. Now take what course you find the best” When their plan to tempt
the Prophet failed,  they approached His uncle- Abu Talib The Prophet’s uncle tried persuading the
Prophet to stop preaching to the people But the Prophet said  “O uncle! if they were to put
 the sun in my right hand, and the moon in my left hand and to stop
me from preaching Islam, I would never stop!” The Prophet, overcome by the thought that
His uncle was willing to desert Him, turned to depart from His home. But Abu Talib called out
to the Prophet loudly. He asked Him to come back. When the Prophet came back, Abu Talib told Him “Say whatever you please.  By the Lord, I shall not
desert you forever! The Priests from different
tribes started publicly prosecuting the supporters of the Prophet. It was during this time that a
Christian king named Al Najashi was ruling Abyssinia. The prophet had heard about
the righteousness, tolerance and hospitality
 of this kind ruler. When the persecution became
 unbearable for the people, the Prophet advised them
to emigrate to Abyssinia. Some 15 families emigrated to this country,  in small groups to avoid detection.  This is called the first Hijrah
 in the history of Islam.  This happened during the fifth year
of the Prophet’s mission. The emigrants received a kind reception
from the king and his people. They were soon followed by many others, who suffered at the hands of
the evil Priests in Makkah. The number of people who emigrated
 soon reached hundred. When the priests heard about this,
they were furious! They decided not to leave
the emigrants in peace. They immediately sent two envoys to
the King, for bringing back all of them. When the envoys met the King, he summoned the poor fugitives and
asked them what they had to say Ja’far the son of Abu Talib, and brother of Ali then spoke
 for the exiles “O king! We were plunged in the depth of barbarism, we adored idols,  we disregarded everything, and we had no law.  Then Allah raised a man among us, who was pure and honest. He taught us to worship Allah, and forbade
us from worshipping the idols. He taught us to speak the
truth, and to be faithful.  We believe in Him, and we have
accepted His teachings. His followers were persecuted, forcing us to back into worship
 the idols again! When we found no safety in among them, we came to your kingdom trusting us
to save us from them"". When the King heard his speech, He asked the envoy to return to their land, and not to interfere with the emigrants. While His followers sought
refuge in foreign lands,  the Prophet continued his preaching
against strict opposition. Some of them mocked at Him, and they asked for a sign. Then the Prophet would say “Allah has not sent me to work wonders,  He has sent me to preach to you” But the Priests persisted
didn’t agree with Him. They insisted that unless they saw sign,  they would not believe in His Lord. The disbelievers used to ask “Why is He not showing any miracles
like the previous Prophets?” “Because miracles had proved inadequate
to convince” answered the prophet. “Noah was sent with signs,
then what happened? Where was the lost tribe of Thamud? They refused to believe in
 Prophet Salih(Alaihissalam) unless they showed a sign. Then the Prophet caused the rocks to break
and brought forth a living camel. He did what they asked for. Then what happened? In anger, the people cut the camel’s feet and again dared the Prophet to fulfill his threat of judgement.  Eventually they all lay dead in
their beds the next morning. There are some seventeen places in Quran,
in which the Prophet is challenged to show a sign. But He gave all of them
the same answer After sometime, the priests
approached Abu Talib again, and asked him to abandon his nephew. But the honorable man declared his
intention to protect the Prophet against any harm. Certain events forced the Quraysh to lift
 the ban on the Muslims. The Prophet and his followers were allowed
to return to Makkah after three long years! In the following year, His uncle
Abu Talib passed away.  He was a great supporter of the
prophet for many years. He had grown very sick and weak, and he
died soon after returning to Makkah. Khadija’s health was not in
great shape either.  She had suffered great hardships. The food was scarce,
and instead of eating herself, she used to give all the food to
her children and husband. Once the richest woman in Makkah
spent her last few days as a poor. She passed away a few days after
Abu Talib’s death Prophet had lost his most loyal supporters.  He was heart broken. He could hardly manage to
keep his mind strong. He called that year the year of sorrow. Whenever he spoke of Khadija, he spoke of
her with great love and fondness. Khadija’slife is a source of
great inspiration to believers, especially women. Her story is a reminder to live
 a purposeful life. We should remember Khadija and
the whole family of Prophet  in our prayers for their
sacrifice and dedication. May Allah be pleased with them all! Thats all Abu. Next time I will tell you another story. Thanks,Massalam Yusuf uncle! May Allah bless you! Massalam Abu!! I will see you soon. Next time when I come here, I will tell you more stories. Sure Uncle, It was a really nice story Thanks a lot uncle! You are welcome my son. May Allah bless you!
Massalama! Maassalama  Uncle Yusuf!"
"Hello, Uncle Yousuf. Assalamu alaikum. Wa alaikum assalam Abu How was the class today? It was good uncle. Do you want to listen to the story of
 Abu Darda (Rali allahu anhu) today? Yes, Uncle.
 Please go ahead. Bismillahirrahmanirraheem The story of Abu Darda
(Rali allahu anhu) Abu Darda(Rali allahu anhu) was one of the companions of  Prophet
 Muhammad(Sallallahu alaihiwasallam ). His full name was
Uwaimir bin Zaid bin Qais. He was a trader in Medina. He was a man of
simplicity and kindness. He was a well-known
wealthy person in Medina and everyone liked and
respected him. He was not a born Muslim.  However, after the Battle of Badr, he got converted into Islam. His preaching’s were basically focused
on the insignificance of worldly wealth. Alhamdulillah! He is such a great person. That is correct my son. He was a marvelous person who was keen on following the path of Prophet
 Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) Hazrath Abu Darda(Rali allahu anhu) always enlightened
the youth with his great wisdom. Once Hazrath Abu Darda (Rali allahu anhu) was walking through the street and found a group of youth
 sitting and chatting. They were also looking
at the passerby. [----Birds chirping---- ] Abu Darda(Rali allahu anhu ) walked
to them and said “My children, the monastery of a
Muslim man is his house in which he controls himself and lowers his gaze. Beware of sitting in the marketplace as
this fritters away time in vain pursuits.” He once said: “None of you can be pious unless he is knowledgeable, and he cannot enjoy knowledge
unless he applies it practically. Once a friend went to
visit him at his home. On reaching Abu Darda’s house,  he realized that the house
 was very small, shorter than the whole
height of a standing man. Abu Darda (Rali allahu anhu) lived in a very poor environment  and he had very few belongings. When the friend saw the state
of his house, he was sad. He said: “Why are you living like a poor man?” Do not worry my dear friend. This is just a temporary home. I am building a better
house somewhere else. The friend thought it was true, and left the house. A few years later, the same friend went back and
found Abu Darda’s(Rali allahu anhu) home  in the same state. He asked Abu Darda(Rali allahu anhu) that why he hadn’t moved to
 the better house. It was then Abu Darda(Rali allahu anhu ) revealed him that the house he referred to, was the Kabr. The friend understood the
nobility of this person, and thanked him for
teaching him a lesson. Once, Abu Darda (Rali allahu anhu) was
 travelling from his home  to a nearby place. There he saw a group of
people beating up a man. When he approached the mob, he saw that the
  man was beaten and berated by them.  He was helpless. He wished all the men standing
there in a gentle voice. “Assalamu alaikum” “Walaikum assalam,
our beloved Abu Darda.” They wished him back
with great respect With his calm and polite voice,  he asked one of them: “My son, may I know what is happening here? Why are you all
beating this man? The man replied: “Beloved Abu Darda, this man did something against the law. He committed a grievous sin. That’s why we are punishing him Abu Darda(Rali allahu anhu) was silent
for a moment and sighed. The man in the middle was eagerly looking at
Abu Darda(Rali allahu anhu) for mercy. Abu Darda(Rali allahu anhu) looked at everyone
standing there and said: All right my dear children. If this man fell into a well,  won’t you help him to get out of the well? One man came forward
and said:  ”Sure, yes.” Abu Darda said: “Then you should treat
this man in the same way” “You should instruct him  and convince him about the sin
he has committed. You should show him
the right path.” “Give thanks to Allah as he
always forgives your sin” A man came forward
then and asked him: “Don’t you hate him?” Abu Darda replied
in a calm voice. “I hate his deeds not him.  He has to stop his sinful actions. If he gives up all his sins, then he is my brother.” On hearing Abu
Darda’s kind words, the sinful man realized his
mistake and started crying. He repented, and led a
good life afterwards. Abu Darda (Rali allahu anhu) was a famous
merchant once upon a time. But after he met the Prophet
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)  he lost his interest in doing business, and he was always found accompanying
 the Prophet(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) [----No audio----]  Once, his friend asked him why he is not
showing interest in his business anymore. He replied: ""Before I met the Prophet
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam), I was a merchant. Then, after converting to Islam,  I tried to lead a life of prayers
 along with my business. Then I realized that I was not able
to give my full devotion to Allah because of my business. I did not want my business
affect my bond with Allah. That’s why I chose to stay close
to Allah rather than my business.” Abu Darda(Rali allahu anhu) made himself free from a lot of
 worldly attachments. On a very cold night,  some pilgrims visited his house. Abu Darda asked the pilgrims to
spend the night at his house. Abu Darda(Rali allahu anhu)
 gave them a warm meal, but did not give them a blanket. When they were about to go to sleep,  they realized that Abu Darda
 (Rali allahu anhu) had not given them any blankets. One man from the pilgrim group wanted to ask Abu Darda (Rali allahu anhu)
  about the blanket. But others discouraged him and
told them not to disturb him, as he must be sleeping.. But the man didn’t
listen to them, and went straight to
Abu Darda’s room . There he found him lying down on the
floor with his wife sleeping beside him. They both were sleeping
without a blanket as well. The next day morning, the man went straight to Abu Darda
 (Rali allahu anhu) and asked why he slept in the cold night without
covering himself with a blanket.. He asked him:“ Being a businessman,
where is your wealth and possessions? He replied to the man, “I shifted all my valuables to the
other house in the village. I am collecting all the required
possessions into that house. He also said, “If there were any blanket here, I would definitely
given that to you.” The man realized
what he had meant. He bowed down respectfully
and left his house. Abu Darda (Rali allahu anhu)  did not leave the trade altogether. He just left the world
ornaments and glory. He needed a bite of bread,  which was enough to
 strengthen the body, and rough clothes to cover the body. During the time of Caliph Umar
(Rali allahu anhu) Abu Darda(Rali allahu anhu) was selected as a high-ranking
 official in  Sham. However, Abu Darda(Rali allahu anhu)
rejected the appointment. Caliph Umar (Rali allahu anhu) asked him
the reason for his decision. Abu Darda (Rali allahu anhu) said: If you want me to go to Sham,  then I'm going to teach them
 the Holy Quran and I will ask them to
pray alongwith me."" The Caliph agreed, and
 Abu Darda (Rali allahu anhu) carried out his mission successfully. Then, Abu Darda
went to Damascus. There he found the people
leading an immoral life. They drank too much and were completely immersed in luxury
and pleasures of the world. Seeing this, Abu Darda
(Rali allahu anhu) became very sad. Therefore, he called the crowd to
the mosque,  and then spoke to them. He made a very spiritual and
emotional speech in the Mosque. He reminded them of the
evil life they were living. He taught them about the
commandant of Allah. He advised them them the need
 of leading a holy life with the Holy Quran as the
 foundation of their life. He taught them about the love of the Prophet
 Muhammad(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) On hearing the speech of Abu Darda
(Rali allahu anhu) the crowd started crying. His speech had created a strong
feeling of repentance in their heart. Their cry could be heard
outside the mosque. Everyone gathered at the mosque changed their way of life that day. From that day, Abu Darda (Rali allahu anhu) regularly visited the assemblies of
 Damascus community and visited the markets. People used to come and ask him
questions on various matters. He answered every question and
enlightened them with his wisdom. He even found time to teach
the negligent in the street. [----Birds chirping----] He used all the opportunities available
to teach the public about the Holy Quran. Once a youth came up to Abu Darda
(Rali allahu anhu)  and asked him to teach him. He said: ""My son,  remember Allah in good times and He will remember you in
 times of misfortune. ""My son, be knowledgeable, seek knowledge, be a good listener  and do not be ignorant for you will be ruined.” While Abu Darda (Rali allahu anhu)
was in Damascus, Mu'awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan
(Rali allahu anhu), the governor, asked Abu Darda to get his daughter married to his son,
 Yazid (Rali allahu anhu). The governor thought that Abu Darda
(Rali allahu anhu) would agree immediately, as his family held a great power.  But Abu Darda (Rali allahu anhu) did not agree his proposal. Instead, he got his daughter married to a young man who was very poor. [-----No audio---- ] He did not care about the wealth
or the power of the governor. [-----No audio---- ] Abu Darda was pleased with the young man's
character and his attachment to Islam, and that’s why he got his
daughter married to him My dear Abu, there are a lot of stories about
 Abu Darda (Rali allahu anhu). It’s the time for prayer now  and I have to go to the Masjid. I will tell you a
different story tomorrow. Sure uncle. I will
wait for you tomorrow. Alhamdulillah! You are such a bright boy.  Now you go and have some snacks.  Let me leave. Ma- assalama. May Allah bless you."
"Asalamu Alaikum. Wa alaikum aslam. How are you Abu? I am fine uncle. Are you going to tell me the
story of the companions today? Yes, Yes. I have told you the story about
 Abdullah Ibn Masood(Rali Allahu Anhu) Inshallah, today I will tell you
bit more about him in detail. Sure uncle. Like I told you in the
previous episode, Abdullah Ibn Masood (Rali Allahu Anhu) was a companion of the Prophet
 Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). He was born in the
tribe of Banu Huzail. People called him ‘Ibn Umm Abd’. His real name was Abdullah and his father’s
name was Masood. When he was a young man, he had heard the stories of the Prophet
 Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) from his own people. But he never paid any
importance to the Prophet, as he lived far
away from Makkah. It was his habit to leave with the
flock of Uqbah early in the morning and work until nightfall. He used to spend most of
his time with the flock. One day while he was working, Abdullah saw two men, who were middle aged, and with
dignified looks walking towards him. [---No dialogue-----] They looked very
thirsty and tired. They came up to him,
greeted him and said: ""Young man, can you
give us some milk so that we may quench our thirst
and recover our strength"". He replied: ""I cannot offer you milk. The sheep are not mine. I am only looking after them"". The two men did not
argue with him. In fact, despite their thirst, they were
extremely pleased at his honest reply. The two men were none
 other than the blessed  Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) himself, and his companion,
 Abu Bakr Siddiq (Rali Allahu Anhu). They were in fact fleeing
from their enemies in Makkah. Abdulla spoke with the Prophet for sometime and soon he realized that the Prophet
 was indeed a brilliant man!. Not long after that incident
Abdullah Ibn Masood (Rali Allahu Anhu) became a Muslim and decided to follow the Prophet
 Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). He asked the Prophet
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) his permission whether he could stay
 with him as his companion. The Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
 agreed and from that day,  Abdullah Ibn Masood (Rali Allahu Anhu) gave up tending sheep in exchange for looking after the needs of the blessed
 Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). He was the sixth man
to accept Islam. Abdullah Ibn Masood (Rali Allahu Anhu) remained closely attached to the
 Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). He would attend to his needs both
inside and outside the house. He would accompany him on long
journeys and expeditions. He would wake him when he slept. He would shield him
when he washed. He would carry his staff
and his Siwak (toothbrush) and attend to his
other personal needs. It was for these reasons that the
Sahabah used to call him Saheb-e-Siwak, which meant the
bearer of the siwak, Saheb-e-Nalaen meaning the
bearer of the slippers, Saheb-e-Mutahara meaning
the bearer of the water, and also sometimes
as Saheb-e-Wisadah, which meant the bearer
of the bedroll. Abdullah (Rali Allahu Anhu) was the best at reciting the Holy Quran
 among the companions. He understood the Quran
 better than all others. He was therefore considered the most
 knowledgeable person on the Islamic Law. [---No audio---] It so happened that once
a man married a woman. He passed away before he could
set a dowry for his wife. [----Birds chirping---] When the issue was placed
 before the Sahaba, they advised them to go to
Abdullah (Rali Allahu Anhu). The men appoached
Abdullah (Rali Allahu Anhu) but he tried to avoid them and asked them to consult
with someone else. However, they kept
repeating their request. Finally he said: “The woman is
entitled to receive Mehr-e-Misal”, meaning the dowry. “If my verdict is correct,
it came from Allah. If it is incorrect, then know that
it came from Satan and myself. Neither Allah and the
Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) are responsible if the verdict
 I gave is incorrect.” A Sahaba by the name of
Maakal Ibn Al-Ashjai (Rali Allahu Anhu) was also present and he said, “I swear by Allah you have given the same verdict that the
Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) gave in the favour of another man
 sometime back. Your verdict is in accordance with the
Prophet(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)”. When Abdullah heard this, he was very happy and
he praised the Lord. Abdullah Ibn Masood (Rali Allahu Anhu) did Hijrat three times, twice to Ethiopia and
once to Madinah. He participated in every Gazwah. It was he who encountered
Abu Jahl in Badr. It was to him that the
Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) presented Abu Jahl’s sword as a gift. Once, the Caliph Umar(Rali Allahu Anhu)
sent Abdullah (Rali Allahu Anhu) to Kufa to educate the people and to
take charge of the Bayt al-mal When Umar fixed salaries
for the Sahabah, he offered to pay
Abdullah a salary too. [---No dialogue---] However, Abdullah
refused and asked: ‘Why are you trying to
attach me to the world” [---Birds chirping---] On another occasion, the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
once called Abdullah (Rali Allahu Anhu) and asked him to recite
verses from the Holy Quran. [----No audio--- ] Abdullah asked the
Prophet respectfully, ""How can I recite to you when
it was revealed to you?"" The Prophet (Sallahu alaihi wasallam)
 answered He wanted to hear the
Quran recited by others. [----No audio---] Abdullah then started reading a part of
Surat An-Nisa till he reached the verse: ‘How will it be then, when We bring from each nation a witness  and we bring you as a witness against
those people.  On that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that they were
buried in the earth, but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allah’ [----No audio----] Upon hearing this the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)’s
eyes flooded with tears and he waved to him saying: ‘Enough, enough, lbn Masood.’ The Prophet was really
moved that day. Abdullah (Rali Allahu Anhu)  never missed the company of the
 Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) even when he was traveling
or if he was at home. He participated in
all the battles, and on the Day of Badr his
role was significant. The Prophet (Sallallahu alaihu wasallam)'s
caliphs were also fully aware of his contributions The Commander of the Faithful
Umar lbn Al-Khattab (Rali Allahu Anhu) appointed him as director of the
treasury (Bayt al-mal) in Kufa. [---No dialogue---] Abdullah (Rali Allahu Anhu) lived till time
 of Khalifah Usman(Rali Allahu Anhu) When he was sick and on his death-bed, Usman(Rali Allahu Anhu) came to visit him. Usman(Rali Allahu Anhu) was very sad to see
him in his death bed. [---No dialogue---] He asked him: “What is your illness?” He said: “My sins.” Usman(Rali Allahu Anhu) again asked him: “Do you have any final desires?” He said: “To have the mercy of my Lord.” Usman(Rali Allahu Anhu) then
 offered him some money but Abdullah (Rali Allahu Anhu) refused it. He said that he is not worried about
the poverty in his life. [---No dialogue---] Abdullah Ibn Masood (Rali Allahu Anhu) was
hardly seen in the crowd of life. He was too humble when compared with those who
possessed wealth, power, and social status. Financially, he was poor.  Physically, he was feeble, and socially, he was nobody. However, Islam compensated him
 for his poverty  with a large share of treasures
 of Khosrau and Caesar. Islam also compensated him for his
physical weakness with a strong will, that conquered the oppressors, and helped to change the whole
 historical course of events. Again, Islam compensated his humble
social status through knowledge, and honors that gave him an eminent place among the most prominent
 of historical figures. He was a noble soul,  and a man of strong faith.  He was guided by Allah, educated by the Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam), and enlightened by the Holy Quran. There are many other stories from the life
 of Abdullah Ibn Masood (Rali Allahu Anhu). I will tell those
stories on another day. Sure uncle..Ma-as-salam. Ma-as-salama Abu."
"Hey Abu, Assalamu Alaikum Uncle Yusuf Walaikum Assalam my dear Abu Uncle, it is nice to be here. I’m sure you have a story to tell me Yes my dear, I have a story
 to tell you today, It is about another companion of the
 Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) Uncle Yusuf, I was waiting for you.  I wish to hear the story of
 Salman al Farisi (Rali Allahu Anhu) Sure
Uncle,please go ahead. I am so excited
to hear the story I will tell you the story of
 Salman(Rali Allahu Anhu) The Story of Salman Al Farisi (Rali Allahu Anhu) Salman (Rali Allahu Anhu)
 explained everything that happened at Abu Darda’s 
(Rali Allahu Anhu)'s home to the Prophet. The Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) supported Salman(Rali Allahu Anhu)
 for what he said,  as it was the right thing. Salman (Rali Allahu Anhu) helped the
 Prophet and his companions with his brilliant ideas during the 
time of the crisis. The Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) and Sahabas were always under the
 threat of the enemies.  One day the Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) assembled his Companions for a meeting. They all gathered and discussed their views
about how they could develop a great defense? And then, a long legged man 
with flowing hair, for whom, the Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) bore great love, came to the prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
 with his views. It was none other than Salman Al-Fairisi 
(Rali Allahu Anhu). He held up his head and looked at Medina, which was surrounded by hills, mountains,
an exposed open country, that could be easily broken 
through by the enemy. Salman (Rali Allahu Anhu) had much
 experience in warfare and its tactics in his native Persia. He was a skilled soldier too.  Therefore, he proposed to the Prophet 
Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) something that the Arabs had never
 seen before in warfare. He proposed to dig a trench in
the open areas around Medina. The Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
 found this idea a brilliant one. He asked his people to carry out the plans
 made by Salman (Rali Allahu Anhu). They immediately got to work. During the excavation of the trench,  Salman (Rali Allahu Anhu) took his place among the people
who dug and removed the sand. The Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) 
also took part in the digging. Once it so happened that the workers
were trying to break a rock apart. Their pickaxes could not smash it, in spite of Salman’s strength 
and hard work. Salman (Rali Allahu Anhu ) then went to
the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) to ask him whether the trench could be dug around
 that stubborn and challenging rock. The Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
 returned with Salman (Rali Allahu Anhu)  to see the rock Himself. When He saw it, asked for a pickaxe and asked the
Companions to stay away from the splinters. He said, ‘In the name of Allah,’ and then raised His firm hands gripping
 the pickaxe and hit the rock. The rock broke and an intense
light spread all over. Salman saw that light
shining upon Al-Medina. The Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
 raised the pickaxe again and gave a second blow and the
 rock broke again. When the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
struck his third blow, the rock shattered. The people then got back to work, and successfully finished the
 digging of the trench. When the enemies approached
 the city to attack, they were stunned to see the huge trench! They now had no way to enter into Medina. The forces of the enemy remained in their 
tents for a month, unable to take Al-Medina. One night, Allah sent a storm that
 devastated their tents and the enemies were forced to escape! Salman-Al-Farisi (Rali Allahu Anhu) had an indepth knowledge
 about the Holy Quran. He translated the Holy Quran
into Persian language. He was the first person to interpret and
translate Holy Quran in a foreign language. He was known as the Imam, the Flag of Flags,  the Inheritor of Islam, the Wise Judge,  the Knowledgeable Scholar,  and One of the house of the Prophet
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). These were all titles were given by the Prophet
 Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) Himself. Salman (Rali Allahu Anhu) was appointed
 as the governor of Persian region. He was the commander of
30,000 Muslim troops. Yet, he was very humble. He lived from his
own manual labor. He did not own a house, but instead rested under the 
shades of trees. He was a true believer of Allah. He used to say that he was surprised to
 see so many people spending all their life concerned about
 their life on earth, without a thought of the world above. Salman’s (Rali Allahu Anhu)'s
 death is unknown. However, it was probably during
Uthman ibn Affan’s (Rali Allahu Anhu) reign or the second year of Ali's
 reign that he died. He was a great man
and a great leader. Did you enjoy the story of 
Salman (Rali Allahu Anhu)? Mashallah, that was a
great uncle Yousuf. I love this story very much. He was a great man with great love
 towards the  Prophet, the Holy Quran and the religion. Thanks Abu. Its time for me to leave,  I will tell you another story tomorrow! Ma-as-salam Ma-as-salama Uncle Yousuf! Okay, its time to go home Come on, let us walk home."
"[---Background sound only---] [----No dialogue----] Hello Abu.
 Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Asalam Uncle Do you want to hear a story Abu? A story? Which story are you
going to tell me Uncle? Insha Allah, I will tell you the story of
 Abbad Ibn Bishr (Rali Allahu Anhu) today. That’s great. I’m so excited!  Okay. Bismillahirrahmanirraheem! [---Background sound---] Story of Abbad Ibn Bishr(Rali Allahu Anhu) [---No dialogue---] Abbad Ibn Bishr(Rali Allahu Anhu)  was one of the companions of the  Prophet
 Muhammad(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). He was known for his devotion to worship, knowledge and his courage in the battle. [---No dialogue---] He always loved to read the Holy Quran eagerly and he was famous
 for his recitation. He was a brave man and Quran held
a special place in his heart. There is a story about
 Abbad(Rali Allahu Anhu)  about his courage, and the respect he had
towards Quran. Once Prophet Muhammad(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) and his companions
were camping in a valley during the night.  [---No dialogue---] It was during a time when the enemies of
Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) made plans to kill him. The Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)  feared that those men would attack 
them during the prayer. He arranged his fellow men in ranks
and divided them into two groups and performed the prayer
Salat  al-Khawf (the Prayer of Fear). With one group he performed one Rakah
while the other group stood on guard. For the second Rakah the groups
interchanged their places. Each group completed its prayer
  with one Rakah after the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
 had finished his prayer. [---No dialogue--- ] The Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam), then
departed from that place safely. On the way back, the Prophet pitched
camp in a valley for spending the night. As soon as the Muslims had
settled their camel mounts, the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam), asked: ""Who will be our guard tonight?"" ""We will, Oh
Messenger of Allah,"" said Abbad Ibn Bishr and Ammar
Ibn Yasir, who were brothers. It was Abbad(Rali Allahu Anhu)’s responsibility
to guard the camp. His brother Ammar Bin Yasir was also
there to help him during the night. Abbad(Rali Allahu Anhu) and
 Ammar(Rali Allahu Anhu)  left for the mouth
of the valley to perform their duty.. Late in the night Abbad( Rali Allahu Anhu)
found his brother very tired and he realized that his brother
 needed some sleep. So he asked him: [----No dialogue----] ""My dear brother Ammar,  which part of the night do
 you wish to  sleep,  the first or the second?” ""I shall sleep during the first part,""
said Ammar (Rali Allahu Anhu )  who sounded really tired. Abbad agreed, and he asked his
brother to get some rest. The night was clear,
calm and peaceful. The stars, the trees, and all the rocks appeared to
 celebrate in silence praising their Lord. [---No dialogue---]  Abbad(Rali Allahu Anhu)
 felt serene. There was no movement, no threatening sign. He then thought to himself: [---No dialogue---] Why not I spend the time in
reciting the Holy Quran? And so in the stillness of the night, at the mouth of the
valley in Najd, Abbad stood up and faced the Qiblah. Raising his hand as a gestureof
 surrendering to God,  he entered into the
state of Prayer. Finishing the compulsory opening chapter of the Quran, he began to recite Surah al-Kahf
in his sweet, captivating voice. Surah al-Kahf is a long Surah of
 one hundred and ten verses  which deals in part with the virtues of
 faith, truth and the patience. It was dark, and the enemies were
watching him from a distance. They were planning to attack the
Prophet(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) during the middle of the night. [---- No dialogue---] They saw Abbad(Rali Allahu Anhu) standing and praying
at the opening of the valley. [---- No dialogue---] One of them took out his bow, aimed at
Abbad(Rali Allahu Anhu) and shot an arrow towards him. [---- No dialogue---] Abbad was reciting the Holy Quran,
when the arrow pierced his flesh. But even when the blood was oozing out,
He did not stop reciting the Quran. He pulled out the arrow and
continued with his prayers. The attacker then shot two
more arrows at Abbad (Rali Allahu Anhu) [---- No dialogue---] Even then, he did not
stop his recitation. He pulled out both the arrows and
slowly finished his recitation. He stood on the ground, with
blood flowing from his wounds. He then woke up his brother,
and told him what happened. Ammar (Rali Allahu Anhu) was shocked
 to see him wounded. He then (Rali Allahu Anhu) jumped up
 and began to shout. When the attackers saw this, they ran away.  Ammar (Rali Allahu Anhu) then asked his
brother why he didn’t wake him when he was hit by the first arrow. To this Abbad replied ""I was reciting the verses of Holy Quran
 which filled my soul with calmness, respect, and I did not want to
stop the recitation.” People loved his Quran recitations so much that they used to call him
‘Friend of the Holy Quran’. Once Rasulullah(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)  stood up for prayers in
 Aishah (Rali Allahu Anhu)’s house, which was very close
to the masjid. [---- No dialogue---] It was then that He heard a voice
reciting the verses from Quran It was so pure and sweet, just like angel Gibril(Alaihi salaam) revealed the words to the
 Prophet(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam   ) Rasululla(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
 listened to the recitation and asked Aishah(Rali Allahu Anha)  whether it was the voice of
 Abbad Ibn Bishr(Rali Allahu Anhu) She confirmed that, it
was his voice indeed! The Prophet was so impressed by the
way Abbad recited the Holy Quran. Abbad was really devoted
to the Prophet as well [---- Background sound ---] Abbad was fifteen years old when he heard the
Holy Quran being recited for the first time. It was recited by Musab Ibn Umayr
(Rali Allahu Anhu)  who was sent by the Prophet
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) to teach the people.  Young Abbad was so fascinated
 by his recitation. [---- No dialogue---] Abbad(Rali Allahu Anhu) was one
 of the devoted men whose hearts Allah opened for good In each of the battles that Prophet fought, Abbad(Rali Allahu Anhu) was in the front
ranks and he fought bravely. The Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
realized  that Abbad(Rali Allahu Anhu) was totally
dedicated to Him with his whole heart and soul. And that’s how he became the
companion of the Prophet. Abbad(Rali Allahu Anhu) died the death of a martyr
during the battle of Yamamah.. He had a dream day
before he died. The next day, He told his
friend about the vision he saw. “Last night I saw a dream. The sky had opened up for me. Then it closed and covered over me. Insha Allah, it means my death” [---- No dialogue---] In the next day he was killed
by the enemy in the battle. The vision which he saw in the dream
and its interpretation came true. [---- No dialogue---] The doors of the heaven opened to
welcome the spirit of Abbad(Rali Allahu Anhu) He was a man who had with him,
the light of Allah. He was really lucky to live
 and die for Allah. [---Background sound---] Hmmm. He would always be present in the
front line while facing an enemy. He was always trustworthy in his
dealings with the wealth of Muslims. Mashallah, that was
such a great story!. Yes Abu, Abbad (Rali Allahu Anhu) was a great
inspiration to many people. I will tell you more stories
of Sahabah’s next time when we meet. You take care now. Thank you Yousef Uncle. Ma As Salama. Ma  Salama [---- No dialogue---] [----Background sound----] [----No audio---]"
"[---Background sound ---] [----Crickets chirping----] [---No dialogue---] Hello my dear Abu Alhamdulillah! Hello Uncle Yousuf..
Assalamualaikkum! Waalaikkumsalam How are you my son? I am fine. Thank you. How are you uncle? Insha Allah, I am fine [----No dialogue---] Which story are you
going to tell me today? Inshaallah, I will tell the story of
Abdullah Ibn Masood (Rali Allahu Anhu) [---Background sound --- ] Story of  Abdullah Ibn Masood
  (Rali Allahu Anhu) Abdullah Ibn Masood(Rali Allahu
Anhu ) was born in Mecca When he was young boy,
he worked as a shepherd. He was very courageous and
a brilliant young man. Abdullah (Rali Allahu Anhu) first met the Prophet
Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) when he was with his flocks. The Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
approached him, and asked him for some milk to quench his
thirst and to get his strength back. He said to the Prophet, I am afraid,  I cannot
give you milk. These sheep are not mine. I am only responsible
for looking after them. The Prophet and the companion
did not argue with him. In fact, despite their thirst, they were
extremely pleased with his honest reply. [---Background sound--- ] However, they got enough
milk to quench his thirst. Huh? But How? [---Background sound--- ] Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) touched a sheep and the milk started
 pouring from the sheep! It was then that
 Abdullah (Rali Allahu Anhu ) realized that he was talking with the
Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam ) and his Sahaba. He was very impressed with the
Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam),  and from that day,
he became very close to them. When He narrated this incident
to his mother and his brother, they got converted
to Islam as well!. [---No audio---] He loved and respected the Prophet
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)  so much that he asked Prophet
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)' s permission to serve him for the
rest of his life. Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) agreed
as he liked Abdullah. From that day
Abdullah (Rali Allahu Anhu) remained close to the Prophet
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)  and served him for more than 30 years. He attended the Prophet’s needs
both inside and outside the house. He worked as a personal
servant to the Prophet, taking care of the Prophet’s bedding,
 sandals and travelling. He used to screen the Prophet
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) when he was taking bath. He used to wake him
up after sleep, and walk with him
in the wilderness. Abdullah (Rali Allahu Anhu) used to read
Holy Quran regularly and he got a deep understanding
 about Holy Quran. Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) considered him as one of the
four foremost experts on Holy Quran. He was best at reciting the Holy Quran
among the companions  as he understood it better.  He was hence the most knowledgeable
 person on the Islamic Law. Once a man came to
Umar Ibn al-Khattab when he was standing on the
plain of Arafat and said: “‘I am coming from Kufa where I met a man filling copies of the
 Holy Quran from his memory.” On hearing this Umar
(Rali Allahu Anhu) became very angry. He paced up and down
besides his camel. He was very angry and upset. He could not tolerate anyone who is doing this as he considered it
 as a disgrace to the Holy Quran. He enquired about the name of the this man
who was writing copies of the Holy Quran. The man said the name of the
man was Abdullah Ibn Masood. Hearing Abdullah(Rali Allahu Anhu)'s name
Umar'(Rali Allahu Anhu)s anger subsided. He said to the man: “By Allah, I don't know of any person who is
more qualified in this matter than he is.” Also Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu)
 narrated an incident that happened some time back: [---No dialogue---] ‘One night the Messenger of
 Allah (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)  was having a conversation with
 Abu Bakr(Rali Allahu Anhu) about the situation of Muslims. The Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
 stood and listened to him. He then turned to the
Sahabah’s and said: As fresh as when
it was revealed, then let him read according to the
recitation of Abdullah Ibn Masood.” Abdullah (Rali Allahu Anhu)  received a unique training from
Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) He followed everything what the
Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said, and adapted his manners. Hence people used to tell that he was the man closest to the
Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) in character. The Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) trusted
Abdullah(Rali Allahu Anhu)  in such a way that he did not need any permission
to walk in into the Prophet’s home. And what the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam )
liked most about him was his Quran recitation. Abdullah (Rali Allahu Anhu) had an in depth knowledge about the
 verses of the Holy Quran. He used to share his
knowledge with everyone too. Once Umar Ibn al-Khattab (Rali Allahu Anhu) met a caravan during one
 of his journeys as caliph. It was pitch dark and the caravan
could not be seen properly. Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu) ordered someone
to stop the caravan. ‘From where do you come?’
 asked Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu). ‘From a deep valley,’
came the reply, using the Quranic
expression - Fajj 'Amiq. ‘And where are you going?’
 asked Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu). ‘ To the ancient house,’ came the
 reply from inside the caravan, using the Qur’aanic
expression - Al-Bayt Al-Atiq. Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu) was so impressed and he
commanded someone to ask the person, ‘Which part of the Quran
is the greatest?’ Then someone answered ‘Allah. There is no Deity except Him, the Living, the Self-sustaining. Neither slumber overtakes Him nor sleep,’ replied the person answering,
quoting the Ayat al-Kursi. Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu) was surprised by the answers
coming from inside the caravan. He asked again: ‘Which part of the Quran gives
risk to the greatest hope?’ ‘Say, O my servants, who
have wasted their resources, do not despair of
the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. He is the Forgiving,
the Compassionate.’ He asked many more questions and he got the most satisfying
 answers from inside the caravan. ‘There is a learned person (Alim)
 among them,’ said Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu)
 to his companions. Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu) then
asked,with a smile ‘Is it Abdullah Ibn Masood inside? ‘Yes, by Allah,’ the men
outside the caravan replied. It was Abdullah Ibn Masood
(Rali Allahu Anhu) inside the caravan. [---No dialogue--- ] In addition to this, Abdullah(Rali Allahu Anhu)
was a great soldier too. He had participated in many wars
against the Prophet’s enemies. Huh? But how? Yes. He was a very
courageous person too. [----Background sound ---] One day the Sahabah's
gathered in Makkah. They were very few in numbers. They were unable to recite
 the Holy Quran in the public as the enemy would attack them
 if they were found. So the Sahaba's
asked each other: ""The enemies have not yet heard the
 Holy Quran being recited openly and loudly. Who could recite it for them?” Abdullah(Rali Allahu Anhu) came
forward and said: ""I shall recite it for them."" However, they were all worried
that the enemies will harm him. So they tried to stop him. But He did not agree with them.
He said: [----Background sound ---] “Allah shall protect me and
keep me away from their evil”. [----Background sound---] He then went out to the mosque
until he reached Maqam-e-Ibrahim, which was a few meters
from the Kabah. It was dawn and the enemies
were sitting around the Kabah. Abdullah (Rali Allahu Anhu) stopped
 at the Maqam-e-Ibrahim and began to recite 
the Holy Quran. Hearing Abdullah (Rali Allahu Anhu) reciting the verses
of Holy Quran  the enemies got angry. They turned against him. They went up to him and
began slapping on his face. However, he did not
stop reciting. When Abdullah went back to his companions, blood was flowing from his face. He proved that nothing can stop him
from reciting the verses of Holy Quran. That’s is why once the
Prophet(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said, ‘Read the Quran in the same manner
as Abdullah Ibn Masood(Rali Allahu Anhu) recites. [----Birds chirping---] Abdullah (Rali Allahu Anhu) lived till the
time of Khalifah Usman(Rali Allahu Anhu). When he was sick and on his
death-bed,  Usman ( Rali Allahu Anhu)
came to visit him. Usman(Rali Allahu Anhu) asked him”  ""Shall I give you your stipend which you have refused to take
 for years now?"" He said he did not
want the stipend. Then Khalifah Usman(Rali Allahu Anhu)
 asked him  whether he wished to give the
 stipend transferred  to his daughters’ name. He asked the Khalifah ""Do you fear poverty for my children? I have commanded them
to read Surah al-Waqiah every night for I have heard the Prophet
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) saying, ""Whoever reads Al-Waqiah every night
shall not be afflicted by poverty ever."" Khalifah Usman (Rali Allahu Anhu) 
was amazed  by his reply. He had so much faith  that he knew Allah will save his family
 when he was gone [----No dialogue----] He passed away during the same night  that Khalifah Usman(Rali Allahu Anhu)
 visited him.  His tongue was moist with the
 remembrance of Allah(swt) and with the recitation of the
verses of His Book. [----Background sound----] May Allah have mercy on him. May Allah have Mercy on him. It is time for me to go now.  I will see you soon.  Next time when I come here,  I will tell you more stories Sure Uncle.  It was a really nice story. Thanks a lot Uncle You are welcome my son. May Allah bless you.

"Uthman bin Affan (Radi Allahu Anhu) was born seven years after the
Holy Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). He belonged to the Omayyad
branch of the Quraish tribe. The Umayyads were the most
influential clan of the Quraish, they were the strongest and wealthiest, and Uthman was their “golden child”,
and the most beloved. He was well liked by everyone in his clan
due to his good manners and shyness. Like his predecessor Omar ibn Al Khattab, Uthman was able to read and write. This was an unusual skill
in pre Islamic Arabia. He became a successful trader
and cloth merchant. Throughout his life he was known as a kind,
 generous man and even before  his conversion to Islam  he would freely give money
 to help those in need. He and Abu Bakr
were close friends, and it was Abu Bakr who
 brought him to Islam when he was thirty-four years of age. Uthman formed a very close
relationship with Prophet Muhammad, and he gained intricate knowledge
about the religion of Islam. He narrated 146 traditions directly
 from the Prophet himself and was one of the few people who were
able to write down Quran Some years later he married the
Prophet’s second daughter, Ruqayya. In spite of his wealth and position, his relatives subjected him to torture because he had embraced Islam, and he was forced to
emigrate to Abyssinia. Some time later he returned to Mecca but soon migrated to Medina 
with the other Muslims. In Medina, water was scarce and control of
the wells was tightly held by several men. Because he was a skilful
trader and negotiator, Uthman set about trying to procure
a well for the use of the Muslims. He negotiated a price
for half a well; he would have control one day and
the other owner the next day. However, Uthman gave his
water to the Muslims freely, so nobody wanted to pay for the
water on the alternate days. The original owner of the well had no choice  but to sell his half
of the well to Uthman who nevertheless  paid a fair price for it. He continued to allow the water
to be used freely by all and never reminded the people
 of his charity. He was humble and modest In Medina his business again
 began to flourish and he regained his former prosperity. Uthman’s generosity had no limits. On various occasions he spent a
 great portion of his wealth  for the
welfare of the Muslims, for charity and for equipping
the Muslim armies. That is why he came to be known
as ‘Ghani’ meaning ‘Generous.’ His wife, Ruqayya was seriously ill just before the Battle of Badr and he was excused by the
 Prophet (Sallallahu aliahi wasallam)  from participating in the battle. The illness of Ruqayya proved fatal, leaving him deeply grieved. The Prophet was moved and offered him the
 hand of another of his daughters, Kulthum Because he had the high privilege of having
 two daughters of the Prophet as wives  Uthman was known as 
‘The Possessor of the Two Lights. Uthman participated in the
Battles of Uhud and the Trench. After the encounter of the Trench,  the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
determined to perform Hajj, sent Uthman as his emissary
to the Quraish in Mecca. But the Quraish detained him and
started negotiating with the Prophet. The episode ended with a treaty
with the Meccans  known as the Treaty of Hudaibiya. The portrait we have of Uthman is
of an unassuming, honest, mild,generous and very kindly man,  noted especially for his modesty
 and his piety. He often spent part of the
 night in prayer, fasted every second or third day, performed Hajj every year, and looked after the needy of the 
whole community. In spite of his wealth, he lived very simply and slept on bare sand
 in the courtyard of the Prophet’s mosque. Uthman (Rali Allahu Anhu) knew the
 Qur’an from memory and had an intimate knowledge of the context
and circumstances relating to each verse. During Uthman’s rule the characteristics
of Abu Bakr’s and Umar’s caliphates  impartial justice for all, mild and humane policies, striving in the path of God,  and the expansion of Islam – continued. Uthman’s realm extended
 in the west to Morocco,  in the east to Afghanistan, in the north to Armenia and Azerbaijan. During his caliphate a navy was organized, administrative divisions of the
 state were revised, and many public projects were
expanded and completed. Uthman sent prominent Companions of the
Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) as his personal deputies to
various provinces to scrutinize the conduct of officials and
the condition of the people. His most notable contribution
to the religion of God was the compilation of a complete and
 authoritative text of the Qur’an. A large number of copies of this text were made and distributed all over
 the Muslim world. Uthman’s Caliphate
lasted for twelve years. The first six years were marked by
internal peace and tranquillity. But during the second half of his
caliphate a rebellion arose. The Jews and others, taking advantage of
dissatisfaction among the people, began conspiring against the Caliph. They started airing their complaints
and grievances in the public. They gained so much sympathy that it became
difficult to distinguish friend from foe. It may seem surprising that a
ruler of such vast territories, whose armies were matchless, was
unable to deal with these rebels. If Uthman had wished, the rebellion could have been crushed
at the very moment it began.  But he was reluctant to be the first
 to shed the blood of Muslims, however rebellious they might be. He preferred to reason with them,  to
persuade them with kindness and generosity. He well remembered
hearing the Prophet say, “Once the sword is unsheathed
among my followers, it will not be sheathed 
until the Last Day.” The rebels demanded that he resign
and quit from the post of Caliph. Even some of the other
Companions advised him to do so. He would gladly have followed
this course of action, but again he was bound by a solemn
 pledge he had given to the Prophet. “Perhaps God will clothe you
 with a shirt, Uthman” the Prophet had told him once, “and if the people want you to take it off, do not take it off with them.” One day the rebels surrounded his house and
they were planning to attack and kill him. It was then that Uthman said 
to a well-wisher, “God’s Messenger made a covenant with me and I shall show endurance in 
adhering to it.” After a long siege, the rebels broke into
Uthman’s house and murdered him. When the first assassin’s sword struck
Uthman, he was reciting the verse, “Verily, God sufficeth thee;  He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing” Uthman breathed his last on the 
afternoon of Friday, 17 Dhul Hijja, 35 A.H.(after Hijra) He was eighty-four years old. His love for God and his Messenger kept him both strong and humble in the
face of old age and extreme difficulties."
"Assalamu Alaikum uncle Yusuf Waalikum Assalam, my dear Abu. Uncle Yousuf, I was
waiting for you. I wish to listen to the story  of Salman
Al Farisi (Rali Allahu Anhu).  I will tell you the story of
Salman (Rali Allahu Anhu). The Story of Salman-Al-Farisi (Rali Allahu Anhu) Salman-Al-Farisi(Rali Allahu Anhu) was one of the companions of Prophet
Muhammad(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). He was the first Persian who got converted to Islam. He was so close to Prophet Muhammed
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) that he considered him as his house member. Salman (Rali Allahu Anhu) was born in
Persia in a very rich family. His ancestors were
very wealthy as well. From childhood, he was always
in search of the truth. He ignored the God that his
 family worshipped, and his family didn’t like this behavior. One day he heard about Prophet
 Muhammad(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) while he was staying in Syria. When he heard about the Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahi alaihi wasallam) and his message,  He realized that this was the truth
 he was searching for. He then decided to travel to
Makkah to meet the Prophet. But things didn’t go well for him. On his way to Arabia, someone cheated
him, and he lost all his money. He was then sold as a slave
to a rich man in Medina!. Salman (Rali Allahu Anhu) who had lived his
whole life as rich man now worked as a servant for the wealthy merchant.. As a Slave? That is so cruel. Yes Abu, Slavery was quite
common in those times. One day,Salman(Rali Allahu Anhu) as usual
  was working in fields of his master. He had climbed a palm tree, and he did
his chores sitting on top of it. His master was sitting right
under the same palm tree. It was then that the master's
nephew came running to him. He stood under the palm tree
 and told the master that Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam )  was staying in a nearby place On hearing that the Prophet was closeby, Salman(Rali Allahu Anhu) started
shivering in excitement. He was so excited that he feared he
might fall from the tree, and fall onto his masters head. That’s quite interesting. He quickly climbed down the tree and asked
the nephew about whereabouts of the Prophet? When the master saw his slave talking
to his nephew, he was angry. He slapped him, and shouted at him “How does this matter to you? You get back to your work”. That evening Salman-Al-Farisi(Rali Allahi Anhu) gathered some ripe dates and
 packed it in a box. He silently left his master’s house and went to the place where the Prophet was staying. He reached the place and
went to meet Prophet There, he met Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) He looked at Prophet’s face and was
 mesmerized by his divine charm. He told prophet “I’ve heard that you are a great Prophet. I always wanted to meet you and I always wanted to be your companion”. He gave the box of dates
to the Prophet and said “Please accept these
dates as my offering” The Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
 accepted the offering  and then he asked his companions 
to eat them. However, he did not
eat any of it. Salman (Rali Allahu Anhu) observed that the Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) did not eat the dates. Therefore, he gathered some more dates
 and went to meet the Prophet again. He met the Prophet (Sallallahu
alaihi wasallam) and said: ""I noticed that you did not
eat the Sadaqah I gave. This however, is a gift for you."" The Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam ) was impressed with Salman
 (Rali Allahu Anhu)'s character and he happily accepted his offering. This time, he and his
companions ate the dates. The Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) accepted
Salman(Rali Allahu Anhu) as his companion. In the meantime, his master realized
that his slave was missing. He went searching for him.. The Prophet when came to
know about this, released Salman (Rali Allahu
Anhu) from his slavery by paying a price for him Salman(Rali Allahu Anhu) was 
so blessed that, the Prophet himself helped release
 him from the slavery. People call Salman-Al-Farisi
(Rali Allahu Anhu) as Salman of Good, as he was very caring, and he was 
concerned about others all the time. He was a simple man too. He had only one cloak, which
 he wore and slept on. Once, Salman (Rali Allahu Anhu) visited
Abu Darda (Rali Allahu Anhu) at his home. Abu Darda (Rali Allahu Anhu) was also a
companion of the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). He found Abu Darda (Rali Allahu Anhu)’s
 wife in a miserable state and she looked very tired. He asked her why she was 
looking so tired and upset. He understood from her reply that
 Abu Darda (Rali Allahu Anhu)  had renounced all the worldly materials and he lives only with what
 is just sufficient. At the same time, poverty was
striking them from the other side. Salman (Rali Allahu Anhu) decided to
 talk to Abu Darda (Rali Allahu Anhu) about this and decided to advice him to
make a relaxation on his current style of living. When Abu Darda (Rali Allahu Anhu) 
came back home, he immediately invited Salman 
(Rali Allahu Anhu) to have the meal. However, Abu Darda (Rali Allahu Anhu)
 didn’t eat any, and said that he was fasting. Salman (Rali Allahu Anhu) said firmly: ""I swear to you that I shall not eat
until you too eat along with me."" Salman (Rali Allahu Anhu) spent that
night at their home. During the night, Abu Darda 
(Rali Allahu Anhu) got up to pray but Salman (Rali Allahu Anhu) 
got hold of him and said: ""O Abu Darda (Rali Allahu Anhu),  Allah has a right over you. Your family has a right over you  and your body has a right over you. It is your duty to provide everything
your family and your body needs."" In the morning, they both prayed together. After the prayers, he left his home, and went to meet the Prophet 
Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). Its time for me to leave, I
will tell you another story tomorrow! Ma-as-salama Ma-as-salama Uncle Yousuf!"
"Assalamu Alaikum Walaikum Assalam Uncle, which story are you
going to tell me today? Hmmm. Inshallah, I think I will tell you the story of the paternal uncle of Prophet
 Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) Huh? Who was he? His name was Hamzah ibn Abdul
Muttalib (Rali Allahu Anhu). He was the paternal uncle of the Prophet
Muhammad(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) Please tell his story uncle Alright, now listen carefully! Bismillahirrahmanirrahim The Story of Hamzah bin Abdul
Muttalib(Rali Allahu Anhu) Hamzah ibn Abdul Muttalib was the
son of Abdul Muttalib  ibn Hashim ibn Abd Manaf ibn Qusayy,  who belonged to the Qurayshi
 tribe in Mecca. Hamzah was the paternal uncle of Prophet
 Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). Hamzah used to know the
Prophet not only as a nephew, but also as a brother and friend because
they belonged to the same generation. They always played together and walked
together on the same road of life. But as they grew older, they
departed each one in his own way. Hamzah preferred the life of leisure, trying to climb
the ranks among the prominent Quraysh in Meccah While the young Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) chose the life of seclusion from crowd, immersed in deep spiritual meditation
that prepared him to receive the truth. Hamzah was a warrior, a
hunter and a sportsman. He was little interested in the
day to day affairs of the city. He was big and strong, and people
respected him for his courage. Despite the fact that Prophet and
Hamzah led a different life, Hamzah was always attentive to the
 virtues of his friend and nephew. After being bestowed with Prophethood, Prophet Muhammad(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
 started preaching Islam publicly. But this was not received well
among the disbelievers in Mecca. One day, Hamzah Ibn Abdul Muttalib
was walking around as usual. When he reached the Kabbah, he found of group of Quraishi noblemen
sitting under a tree, engaged in serious discussion. Hamzah sat with them to listen
what they were discussing. He was surprised to hear that they were
talking about the Prophet, his nephew! For the first time, Hamzah Ibn Abdul Muttalib
saw they were worried about his nephew. There was a tone of bitterness and rage
against the Prophet in their voices. Never before had they paid any
serious attention to the Prophet. But now, he could see that
they were really worried. Hamzah laughed at their talks and told
them that they were exaggerating. But the Quraishi didn’t pay any attention,
and they continued with their talks. Hamzah sat there listening to them,
sometimes smiling, sometimes frowning. Days passed and there were frequent discussions
among the Quraishi about the Prophet. Later, whispering turned into provocations
and Hamzah watched all this from a distance. Hamza was impressed by his
 nephews composed, steadfast attitude towards
 their provocations. He knew the prophet from his
early childhood to his youth, then his honest manhood. Hamza knew the Prophet as he knew himself. Since they had grown up together,  his nephew's life had been
as pure as the sunlight to him. It never occurred to Hamza that the Prophet
 could do anything wrong in his life. He never saw his nephew
angry, hopeless or greedy. Hamzah was not only physically strong,
but was also wise in the head. It was natural for him to
follow a man of honesty, truthfulness he wholeheartedly believed in. One day, Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) was in deep meditation at the
 foot of Safa mountain. It was then that Abu Jahl, one of the
leader of Quraish, was passing by. When Abu Jahl found that the Prophet was
alone, he decided to take this opportunity. Abu Jahl went to him and started abusing
him in a vulgar language, and struck him! But the Prophet remained calm, he stood up and not uttering a word,
 returned home. That day Hamzah, as usual was
returning home after hunting,  carrying his bow in his hand. It was then that the servant girl
of Abu Jahl ran to him shouting She said “Oh Hamzah,  have you seen what happened to your 
nephew at the hands of Abu Jahl?”.  she went on to explain what
 Abu Jahl had done to the prophet Hamzah was really angry when he heard this. He rushed to the Kabbah to
 confront Abu Jahl. When he saw him sitting among other
Quraysh leaders, he roared like a lion! Hamzah walked calmly towards Abu Jahl
and hit him with his bow till it broke,  and his skin bled. Then he said “How dare you rebuke
my nephew and strike him?” Then he declared “I recite la illahaillalahu
Muhammad rasulullah  and I accept Islam, the religion of
 Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)”. In a moment the men gathered there  all forgot about how their leader
 Abu Jahl had been insulted! They were all thunderstruck by the news
that Hamzah had converted to Islam! They couldn’t believe that the strongest and the most dignified among the Quraishi 
young men had been converted to Islam. The Quraishi knew that this was a disaster. They knew that Hamza’s conversion would inspire many young men to follow
 the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) They were concerned that the Prophet
would soon gain many more followers. Hamzah possessed a sharp sight
and clear consciousness. He went home and after he had
 relaxed from the days exhaustion, he sat down to think over
 what had happened. He had announced his conversion
in a moment of rage. He hated to see his nephew being
insulted and suffering without any help. But he was confused of whether
he had done the right thing. Was this the ideal way for anyone to change
the religion of his parents and ancestors? He was not yet familiar 
with the teachings of Islam, and didn’t acquire enough
  knowledge of this religion. It was true that Hamzah 
never had any doubts about Prophet’s integrity,  but could anybody embrace a new religion
 just in a moment of rage as he had done? Hamzah started thinking. He spent many restless
days and sleepless nights. When one tries to attain the 
truth by the power of mind,  uncertainity will become a 
means of knowledge, and this is what happened to Hamzah. At the Kabbah, he prayed and 
supplicated to the heaven, seeking help from every source
 that existed in the universe  to be guided to the right path. And at last he got his answers. Allah filled his heart
with faith and certainity. In the morning, he went to Prophet 
Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam),  and he told him about his decision 
to convert to Islam. The Prophet was happy to hear about this and He prayed to Allah to keep
His heart stable in Islam. That’s all Abu. Next time I will tell
you another story. Thanks! Massalama Yusuf Uncle! May Allah bless you! Massalam Abu"
"Assalamu Alaikum Walaikum Assalam How was your school today? It was good uncle.
How was your work? It was fine Abu. So have you finished
your homework? Yes Uncle, I had finished that
as soon as I reached home. Very good Abu.  So are you ready for the story then? I am Uncle The Story of Hazrat Bilal Ibn
Rabah (Rali Allahu Anhu) One morning, Bilal left his
house and went to Holy Kaaba. He saw that there were many idols kept
in front of the Holy Kaaba- Golden idols, the small wooden idols
and stone idols. “Oh you unable idols!” he shouted “how can you defend yourselves? “You do not deserve worship! You will become extinct some day” Bilal left Holy Kaaba and
returned to his master's house. When he entered the house,  he head the shouts of his master
 along with his friends.  But he didn’t mind them. Suddenly, a friend of his master opened the
door and went running to speak to Umayyah. He went directly to Umayyah and
whispered something in his ear. When Umayyah heard this,  his
face was now red with anger. “Are you sure about what you saw?” Umayyah asked the man “Yes.. I saw it with my own
eyes!” replied the man “I have seen him with
Muhammad many times as well” “We will teach him a lesson
tomorrow” said Umayyah The people of Makkah saw Bilal being dragged
to the city square the next day.  Umayyah and his friends  dragged the bound Bilal The evil men began
to torture Bilal. He was tied with ropes and made to lie on
the burning hot desert sand at mid noon. He was then asked to forget
 the God of Islam  and worship their great idols. But Bilal was strong
in his new faith. He refused to worship the idols
 and kept crying “AHAD"" AHAD”, meaning “One God,  One God.” The tortures continued  and were increased.  Hot iron rod were stamped
on his pained body. Yet Bilal would not yield. On one hot day,  Bilal lay on the
burning hot sand tied to the ground. A very heavy stone was placed
 over his chest.  Bilal could no longer bear the heat
and the load was so great. He had also grown weak. In that condition,  he was even denied water to drink. He lay there with
his lost senses. AS the day neared its end,
 it became cooler.  He regained his consciousness. He found that the heavy stone
was no more on his chest. He wondered who had come
to free him from his pain. His heavy eyes slowly opened only to look  at the bright smiling face of Prophet
Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) Prophet had heard and seen
the torture of Bilal. It pained him extremely to learn that a true
believer should suffer in such a manner. He also felt pity
for the poor man. He asked Abu Bakr(Rali Allahu Anhu) to purchase Bilal
from Umayya and set him free. Abu Bakr did as he was told and
purchased Bilal from Umayyah. Bilal was now a free man. Prophet set many other
slaves free as well. He insisted that slaves be
treated fairly and kindly. The days in Makkah was nearing an end. Bilal ibn Rabah and other followers of Islam
 went to Medinah as Prophet ordered. Bilal’s patience and fiath in Allah caused him to be chosen
by the Prophet to call to people of Medinah to prayers. For the first time in Medinah, the town reasonated with the Adhan as 
Hazrat Bilal (Rali Allahu Anhu) recited it. There is also one incident that happened when a few  Sahabah started
 getting jealous of Bilal and his Adhan. They met the prophet and complained to him that Bilal does not pronounce 
‘Ashhadallah  Elaha ’ the Arabic way The Prophet said he loved the pronunciation in
the African way more than the Arabic way,  because of his sincerity towards Islam. When Bilal recited the prayer call, all the Muslims of Medinah
went to the mosque  and prayed along with the Prophet. One day the people of Medinah heard the
prayer call way before the prayer time. The people were confused and
ran towards the mosque. When they were all gathered, they realized that there was a large army
outside Medinah waiting to attack them. The Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) gathered the men and defended the attacks
 successfully because of the warning. Months passed, and Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) had departed from this world.  Bilal was grief splitten and he
 cried for many days. He went to recite the Adhan,  and when he came to recite the name of
the Prophet,  he was overcome with grief and
 broke down in tears. When the people heard this,  they too broke down in tears and
 started sobbing uncontrollably. Bilal managed to complete the Azaan
 with great difficulty. After that day he decided
to no longer recite the Azaan as the grief was just too much for him to handle. He couldn’t stay in Medina anymore,  so he joined the Muslims army
 settled in Damascus. One day as he was sleeping in Damascus,
 he saw the Prophet in a dream!  The Prophet asked him why wasn’t Bilal visiting him in Medina? As soon as he was awake,  he set out for the city of Medinah. Upon his arrival in Medinah, the grandsons of Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)came to visit him. Bilal had deep love and affection for them  and he was overjoyed to meet them.  When the grandsons of the Prophet
 requested him, he recited the Azaan for one last time. The people of Medinah were
surprised to hear his voice. They were reminded of the days when the
Prophet lived.  When they heard the voice of Bilal,
they came out of their houses in tears! After a few days Hazrat Bilaal
 (Rali Allahu Anhu) returned to Damascus and
he eventually passed away. We are Muslims today because of the great sacrifices by our beloved Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) and others.  It is through our beloved Hazrat Bilal
 (Rali Allahu Anhu)'s cries of “Absolute Oneness.. Absolute Oneness.. Ahad..Ahad” that we are blessed today with faith. It is through their sacrifices that we are
able to recite the Holy Quran today. Everytime we hear a Qari recite, let us remember
Hazrat Bilal(Rali Allahu Anhu)'s) cries. Mashallah..He was truly a loyal companion! That's all Abu, Next time I will tell you another story. Thanks.
Maassalam Yousuf uncle, May Allah bless you. Maassalam Abu"
"Assalamu Alaikum uncle, Walaikum Assalam Abu. Come sit here..  I’m so glad that you are loving
 the stories Abu Yes Uncle.
 I just love the stories Inshallah. I will tell you the story of Hamzah
 Ibn Abdul Muttalib (Rali Allahu Anhu) Allah supported Islam with
the conversion of Hamzah. He was strong in defending the
Prophet and His companions. Hamzah was unable, of course to
 prevent all the harm alone, but his conversion was a shield
 that protected Muslims. He was the first inspiration for
many people to embrace Islam. The second source of inspiration came from the conversion of 
Umar ibn Al-Khattab(Rali Allahu Anhu) Since his conversion, Hamzah devoted all his life and power
 to Allah and His religion. The Prophet honoured him with the noble
title “The Lion of Allah and His Messenger” Hamzah led the battle against
the enemies of the Muslims. The first banner that the Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) handed any Muslim was Hamza(Rali Allahu Anhu). Hamza performed great deeds
during the battle of Badr. In the Battle of Badr,
 he performed a great feat which led the Muslims to defeat
the Quraishi easily. The wounded Quraishi fled from the battlefield
and stumbled back to Mecca disappointed. But they were not willing to
accept the defeat easily. They started to prepare the
army for another war instead. The next battle was called
the Battle of Uhud. The cunning Quraishi men knew that
winning the battle was impossible  as long as Prophet and Hamzah
 remained in the field, They decided to choose a man
who could assassinate Hamza. There was an Abyssinian slave
named Wahshiy,  who possessed extraordinary skills
 with the spear. He could strike with his spear at
distant objects very precisely. They offered him many gifts and also told
 him that he would have his freedom,  if he killed Hamzah. Wahshiy was hesitant at first but the thought of freedom made
him accept the offer They told that his only role in the war was to kill
Hamzah wth his spear, and nothing else. They warned him not to engage himself in
anything other than Hamzah, regardless of the situation
 in the battlefield.  He was offered excellent rewards
 if he achieved this feat. The slave was owned by Jubair ibn Muktam. Jubair’s uncle had been killed in
 the battle of Badr. He was angry at the Prophet
 and other followers, so Jubair said to him “Kill Hamza and you will be set free.” Afterwards, the Quraish sent Wahshiy
 to Hind Bint Utbah,  who was the wife of Abu Sufiyaan. The Quraish wanted her to encourage the
 slave as she had lost her father, uncle, brother and son in the war. It was said that Hamzah had
been behind their deaths. Hind had been the most enthusiastic to
escalate the war among the Quraish. All she wanted was Hamzah’s
death, at any cost. She spent days before the battle
filling the Wahshiy’s heart with rage. She promised him that if he killed Hamzah, then she promised to give her
 precious trinkets. Wahshiy’s heart now yearned for the battle.  He thought of his freedom, 
the jewellery and his mouth watered The two armies met for
the Battle of Uhud. Hamzah was in the middle of the
battlefield, in a battle dress. Hamzah was like a lion
in the battlefield. He moved everywhere,  it seemed like the death was 
at his command! The Muslims were about to gain victory and defeated army of Quraish started to
 withdraw from fight. Then the Quraish launched a surprise
attack at the Muslims from behind! The Muslims tried to pull
 themselves together, picking up weapons they had put down when they saw the Quraish withdrawing. But the attack was a violent one. When Hamzah saw this, he doubled
up his strength and activity. Hamzah approached the Quraish
army, striking all around. In the meantime, Wahshiy was observing him
closely not participating in the fighting. He saw Hamzah in the middle of
the crowd like a huge camel! He hid behind a tree waiting for
 him to come closer. When he saw that Hamza was close enough,  he took his spear and
 aimed at Hamza’s heart. And then he threw the spear! The spear penetrated him from the back, and within moments Hazrat Hamzah ibn
 Abdul Muttalib(Rali Allahu Anhu) died! The slave then approached his body, took his spear and slowly walked away
 from the battlefield. The Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) was deeply saddened by the death 
of Hamzah(Rali Allahu Anhu) He bestowed with him the title “Lion
of God” and the “Chief of the Martyrs” It is time for me to go now I will see you soon. Next time when I come here,
 I will tell you more stories. Sure uncle, it was really a nice story! Thanks a lot uncle You are welcome my son May Allah bless you.
Ma assalama Ma assalam uncle Yousuf."
"Asalamu alaikum uncle Wa alaikum asalam Abu Uncle, I need your help. I need to know about a Sahaba named
Noaman Ibn Muqqarin (Rali Allahu Anhu). I was searching in this book
and I couldnt find anything. Insha allah,  I will tell you the story of Noaman Ibn
Muqqarin (Rali Allahu Anhu) today. Now listen carefully.. Story of Noaman
Ibn Muqqarin (Rali Allahu Anhu) Noaman Ibn Muqqarin (Rali Allahu Anhu)  was one of the companions of the Prophet
 Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). He was a member of
the Al-Mazeena tribe that lived in the
outskirts of Yathrib He was first among those who embraced Islam on the invitation of Prophet
Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). He was the son of Ubaid bin
Aus, an Ansar of Medina. Ubaid bin Aus participated
in the Battle of Badr, where he captured four men
and tied them in one chain. For this act of binding, the Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)  nicknamed him Mugarrin,
 the Binder. Noaman Ibn Muqqarin (Rali Allahu Anhu)  heard about the Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) and was very much impressed
with his ideologies. Noaman Ibn Maqarrin (Rali Allahu Anhu) was the chief of their tribe and
 he was very influential. One evening while he was sitting among the
elders and other members of the tribe,  he addressed them: ""O my people, we have learnt only good about the Prophet
Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam),  and of His mission we have heard nothing
 but mercy, kindness and justice. What's wrong with us? Why do we stay inert while everyone
 else is following Him? [----No audio----]  As for myself, I have made up my mind to leave
early in the morning to join Him. Whoever of you wishes to go with me,
let him get ready."" Noaman Ibn Muqqarin (Rali Allahu Anhu) must
have been a great chieftain. His words had a wonderful
 effect on his people. The following morning Noaman Ibn Muqqarin (Rali Allahu Anhu)'s
 ten brothers and four hundred horsemen of the Al-Mazeena were all ready and prepared to go
 with Him to Yathrib, to meet the Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)  and convert into Islam. He felt embarrassed to go to the Prophet
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)  who was such a great person, without carrying any
presents for him. There was not much he
could carry anyway. It was a year of drought
and famine in Yathrib, and much of people’s livestock
and crops had perished. Still, they asked help from their
fellow tribesmen and gathered whatever sheep and goats were left. They drove the flock before
them and travelled to Madinah. Once they reached Madinah, they met the Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) There in the presence of the Prophet
   Muhammad(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam), he and his fellow tribesmen,  they announced their acceptance of Islam. They started to follow the path of Prophet
 Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)  and kept the Holy Quran close
 to their heart. The whole of Madinah celebrated with excitement when
Noaman Ibn Muqqarin (Rali Allahu Anhu)  and his companions arrived. Never before had a single family with all eleven brothers accepting
 Islam at the same time, along with other four hundred men!! The Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
 was glad and rejoiced greatly. The sincerity of his effort was
accepted and commended by Allah. Noaman Ibn Muqqarin (Rali Allahu Anhu)  lived under the guidance of the Prophet
Muhammad(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) and participated in all the campaigns
 with total dedication. Noaman Ibn Muqqarin (Rali Allahu Anhu) and his
brothers were great soldiers too. Prior to the Battle of Qadissiya, which delivered Iran to the Islamic fold, a delegation of the Islamic government was sent to the emperor of Iran, to invite him to Islam. He appointed Noaman Ibn
 Muqqarin (Rali Allahu Anhu) as the leader to act as the chief
 spokesman of the Islamic government. When they arrived at the Palace, Noaman Ibn Muqqarin,  asked the emperor
 to surrender himself to Allah. The plain speak by Noaman Ibn Muqqarin
(Rali Allahu Anhu)  infuriated the Iranian emperor. He was very angry and said: ""I would have dealt sternly with you,  had I not been bound by
International convention to respect the rights of the ambassadors"". He then ordered his men  to expel the delegation out of the
boundaries of the Iranian sultanate. He then ordered that a bag of
soil be tied around their necks. The emperor also warned them
 against the war  and said he would bury them and their leader in the trenches of
 Qadissiya  if they ever thought of war. They took the bag of soil to
 the commander-in-chief, Sad ibn Abi Waqqas,
 and said to him: “Accept our congratulations
for the victory. The enemy has voluntarily
surrendered his territory to us”. A battle with the
 Persian army broke out, and the prophet’s army won. The victory paved the way for the Muslim advance into the plains of the
 Euphrates and the Tigris. Prophet’s followers were still facing
a great threat from the enemies. Once Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu) received news of a
 massive Persian mobilization of about 15O,OOO warriors
marching to attack them. He thought of leaving Madinah and
facing the massive threat himself. But he was advised against this
by prominent leaders in Madinah. They suggested instead that he should appoint a
military commander to confront this grave situation. Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu) appointed
 Noaman Ibn Muqqarin (Rali Allahu Anhu)  as the commander of the Prophet’s army Before the battle they all
 gathered together and prayed.  He gave instructions to his men regarding the tactics they needed to
 follow during the battle. The prayer gave them
a new confidence. They were now confident
of winning this battle. He then prayed: ""May God grant victory
to our people."" In the battle, the Muslim
forces emerged victorious. The Persians never
recovered themselves. The Islamic historians have called
this ""the Victory of Victories"". Everyone was searching for Noaman
Ibn Muqqarin (Rali Allahu Anhu) to congratulate him for the victory. Unfortunately, Noaman Ibn
Muqqarin (Rali Allahu Anhu) received a mortal blow
during the battle.  His brother took the standard
 from his hand, and covered him and concealed
his death from the others. He was killed during the second phase
of the Battle of Nihawand on the third week of December 641. As people came searching for their leader  Noaman Ibn Muqqarin (Rali Allahu Anhu), his brother removed the chador to show them
 the body of  Noaman (Rali Allahu Anhu). He had fallen martyr but delivered
the much needed victory. His death was a great
shock to everyone. They sent message to
 Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu)  about the death of Noaman Ibn
 Muqqarin (Rali Allahu Anhu) When the news about the death of Noaman Ibn
Muqqarin (Rali Allahu Anhu) was delivered to Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu), he placed his head in his
hands and began to cry. [----Background sound----] He contributed a lot for
his fellow Muslims. He gave his life for the
prosperity of Islam. He was a great leader
and a great soldier. That’s true. Thank you uncle for
today’s story. You are welcome my son. I have to leave now. I will tell you another story
next time when we meet. Ma-as-salama uncle. Ma-as-salama Abu"
"Assalamu Alaikum Walaikum Assalam Uncle, which story are you
going to tell me today? Inshallah, I will tell you the story of Hazrat
Miqdad Ibn Aswad al-Kindi (Rali Allahu Anhu) Mashallah, that is great. Please tell me Uncle. Bismillahirrahmanirrahim Hazrat Miqdad Ibn Aswad al-Kindi
 (Rali Allahu Anhu) was one of the companions of Prophet
 Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). He was also known as Miqdad Ibn
Amr al-Bahrani, he was one of the most respected Sahabah. Miqdad was a brave young man who belonged
to an Arabian tribe named Bahra. He was originally from
Hadhramaut Yemen. He escaped from his tribe
when he was very young. When He reached Mecca, he worked
for a man named al-Aswad al Kindi. In Arabia people loved
brave and strong men. His master did not have any children and he soon grew fond of Miqdad. One day, al-Aswad al Kindi stood
amongst the tribe of Quraishi and said “I am declaring from this
day on Miqdad as my son. His name will be Miqdad
Ibn Aswad al-Kindi. After I die, he will inherit me” From that day on, people started
calling him Miqdad ibn Aswad al-Kindi. It was the a way Arab people
showed their love towards someone. When Miqdad was 24 years old, Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)  had started spreading Islam in Mecca. Miqdad too heard about
Prophet’s mission. Miqdad too joined Islam. He kept his religion a secret. But the Quraish tribe had started
persecuting the Muslims. When this happened, Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) asked his companions to immigrate to
Medinah. The followers of Islam immigrated
 one by one or in groups. Miqdad too joined the people
and travelled to Medinah. He was one of the
last to migrate When he reached Medinah, the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi
 wasallam) had already reached there, and he invited him to stay with him. Miqdad once shared a story of an event that
occurred while he stayed with the Prophet. It so happened that Miqdad
(Rali Allahu Anhu) and few others were staying at the house
of Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) One day, as usual, they returned to
Prophet's house after the days work. There were bowls of milk left
for each of them. Everyone drank their share, but Miqdad still felt hungry even
 after drinking his share of milk. It was then that the Shaitan came to him,  and told him to drink the
 Prophet’s share as well! At first Miqdad refused,  but when
the Shaitan compelled him even more. At last, he gave up, and drank the
Prophet’s share of milk as well!. As soon as he had finished,
 he felt guilty. He didn’t know what to do, so he pretended to be asleep when the Prophet
Muhammad(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) walked in. When Prophet saw someone had his
share of milk, he made a dua “O Allah, feed the one who feeds me, quench the thirst of the one who
 quenches my thirst” Upon hearing this, Miqdad got up, he
wanted to be the one to feed the Prophet. He went to the
goat to milk them. He noticed that even though the goat had
been milked earlier, the udders were full! He milked the goat and gave it to Prophet, and he drank to his fill. There was still a lot of milk left, and Miqdad drank the milk and
 satisfied his hunger as well. It was a miracle from
 Allah (Subhanahu wa ta'ala) Miqdad Ibn Aswad al-Kindi
 (Rali Allahu Anhu) also had the honour of being related to the
 Prophet Muhammad(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) After having trouble getting
 married for some time, he eventually got married to the cousin of
Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). Thus, they became
relatives as well. When the Muslims immigrated
 from Meccah to Medina, the disbelievers attacked and
robbed their houses. The Prophet wanted to bring back
the belongings of his people. He tried to reason with the Quraish
 in the first place,  but they were not willing to listen. The Prophet had no option left, other
than to declare war against the Quraish. The Prophet and his companions never
set out for war before the battle of Badr. They had actually set
out to recover their belongings ,  but Abu Sufiyan, the Quraish leader
 declared war on the Muslims. This unexpected turn of events
 called for an important decision and quick resolve as the Muslims
 had never fought before. The Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) consulted his companions, saying  “O people, give me your counsel.” First Abu Bakr (Rali Allahu Anhu)
 stood up and spoke, followed by Umar Ibn Al-Khattab
(Rali Allahu Anhu). But the Prophet was not satisfied,  and he repeated “O people, give me your consel” This is when Miqdad ibn Al-Kindi
(Rali Allahu Anhu) came forth and spoke “O Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) execute the plan which Allah
has shown to you, for we are with you. By Allah, we will not say to you as
the children of Israel said to Musa: “So go you and your Lord and fight you
 two, we are sitting right here”; Instead, we say to you , ‘go you and your Lord and fight:
we are with you and will fight.’ “And by the One who sent
you with the truth, if you led us to Birkul-Ghimad, we would fight alongside with you against
those who come before it,  until you reached it. And we will indeed fight at your
 right and from your left, and from before you, and from behind you-
 until Allah makes you victorious.” The Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) was really happy when he heard this. Everyone present there agreed
with Miqdad’s opinion. The Prophet Muhammad(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
then decided to fight the Quraish. The Battle of Badr began. The Muslims were full of enthusiasm. They faced the disbelievers with
 hearts filled with faith. And pretty soon the
Muslims won the battle. The Muslims took the prisoners
of war and headed for Medina. Miqdad wanted ransom. He wanted the Quraish to return the belongings
of Muslims in return for the prisoners. The Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu
alaihi wasallam) knew this, so he raised his hands towards the sky
and said: “Allah! Make Miqdad ibn Aswad
 rich with your favour!” The enemies used to kill the Muslims
whenever they captured one. Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) didn’t want to be like them. The Prophet asked his companions to treat
other remaining prisoners of war kindly. Besides he released some prisoners
without ransom because they were poor. And he asked the prisoners who could read and
write to teach the Muslim kids as a ransom. The Muslims fought many other wars
including the Battle of Uhud. The Battle of Uhud was a
lesson for the Muslims. They learnt a lot from it. They learned how to obey the Prophet at any rate,
 for obedience to him meant victory, and disobedience meant defeat. Miqdad Ibn Aswad deeply believe
in Allah and His Prophet. That’s why our master Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said about him and about some of his companions. “Allah has ordered me to love four persons, and He has told me that He loves them. These four persons are  Ali, al-Miqdad,  Abu Zar and Salman. When the Prophet Muhammad(Sallallahu
 alaihi wasallam) passed away, Miqdad was deep in sorrow for many days. Miqdad ibn Aswad taught
people the Noble Quran. His reading became famous in all of Sham. He stayed loyal to his
religion till his end. When he was almost ninety years old,
 he passed away in Dimashq. The Ziyarat of Sahabi Hazrat Miqdad ibn
Aswad al-Kindi (Rali Allahu Anhu) is five miles from Zinabiya, on the road to
 the centre of present day Damascus. Mashallah, He was truly a loyal companion. Thats all Abu. Next time I will tell you another story. Thanks, Ma assalam Yousuf uncle. May Allah bless you! Ma assalam Abu."
"Umar Ibn-Al-Khattab(Radhiallahu anhu) was one of the most powerful and
 influential Muslim caliphs. He belonged to Banu Adiyi family
tribe of Quraish in Makkah. He was the second Caliph
after Abu Bakr (Radhiallahu anhu) and senior companion of Prophet
Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). If you look back in the history of Islam and the people who played a great role
 in spreading Islam the one prominent name comes in your
mind will be of Umar(Radhiallahu anhu ). Here we are going to describe the biography
of Umar(Radhiallahu anhu) in this video. There are a lot of things
 which can describe him and we can learn about his early life, bravery, acceptance of Islam, caliphate period and much more. Umar Ibn-Al-Khattab(Radhiallahu anhu)
 was born in 583 A.C in Banu Adiyi family a tribe of
Quraish in Makkah. He was not Muslim in the
beginning and by occupation, he was a businessman. Before accepting Islam; Umar(Radhiallahu anhu) was one of the most extreme enemies
of Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). Umar(Radhiallahu anhu) was one of the
 educated people in Quraish family in that period of time when only a
 few people could read &amp; write. He also got familiar with the
art and science of genetics, and was well versed with
the history of the Arabia. He was very brave; Umar(Radhiallahu anhu) was a well-known
famous wrestler, debater, and a spirited person
in his youth time. He was also famous for his
flawless horse-riding skills. He was an intelligent person and a renowned public speaker and a
successful ambassador of Quraish. Although Umar(Radhiallahu anhu) had
flawless intellectual and physical talents, unfortunately, he had not accepted the messages of the
 Holy Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). He was one of the fanatic enemies of Prophet
Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). He opposed Islam and threatened
to kill the Prophet often. One day he decided to
kill the Holy Prophet. When he was on his way
to execute his plan, he came to know about his sister and
brother in law embracing Islam. He went to his sister's house where she
and his brother in law were being taught Quran by
Khabab(Radhiallahu anhu). He inquired about their acceptance of
Islam and started fighting with them. He slapped his sister in a way
that she started bleeding. When He saw His sister bleeding,
he calmed down out of the guilt. He then asked his sister to
show the pages of Quran. He recited the Quran
after taking bath; it was the beginning
of Surah Ta Ha. After reading for sometime,
he came to the verse: “Indeed, I am Allah. There is no deity except Me, so worship Me and establish
prayer for My remembrance.” He was greatly moved by the Holy verses
and approved them as the words of Allah. Umar then went to Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). On seeing him, Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) asked him, “Umar! What brings you here”? He said,
 “I am here to accept Islam “. And that’s how he
accepted Islam. In the early days Muslims were
 not able to offer Salah publicly due to fear of chiefs of Quraish. But when Umar(Radhiallahu anhu)
 accepted Islam, believers came out openly as they knew no one had dare to
 face Umar (Radhiallahu anhu). He was the one who first suggested the
 Holy Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) that they should perform
Salah in the Holy Kaaba, where the Messenger of Allah for the
first time led the Muslim prayer. Due to such fearless
proposals by  Umar, he was given the title of
Al-Farooq by the Prophet, which means “the one who distinguishes
between the right and the wrong”. One of the famous statements of Umar was that he
used to immediately get angry with people  who would step out of line, and would ask the Prophet for
permission to “deal with it”. But the prophet
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) would say “Relax, relax Oh ibn Khattab, I have not been
sent to be harsh. I have been sent as a
mercy to mankind.” Time passed and one day
the Prophet passed away. When Umar heard this news,
he was very angry and said “Whoever says Muhammed has
passed away, I will execute him” Abu Bakar Siddiq(Radhiallhu anhu ) got up and explained the truth and it was 
only then that He calm down. There was a dispute among the Muslims
regarding as to who would become their leader. Who would take the responsibility after the death of Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). It was then that Umar(Radhiallahu anhu) addressed Muslims about the great character
 of Abu Bakar(Radhiallahu anhu). He explained to the people about
his closeness to the Prophet and suggested to make him
the first caliph of Islam. People listened to His words, and appointed Abu Bakr
as the first Caliph of Islam. But things didn’t go well, and
Abu Bakar soon passed away. After the death of Abu Bakr
(Radhiallahu anhu) Umar(Radhiallahu anhu)
 took the responsibility and became the second Caliph. He followed the footsteps of Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) to the full extent. It was  Umar, under whose rule
Islam became an international power. The mighty empires of Persia and Byzantine
collapsed before the army of Islam. Within ten years of
his glorious rule, the whole of the Persian Empire, Syria,
Palestine, Egypt and a part of Turkey came under the banner of Islam. He was not only a
great commander, but also an excellent
administrator. He designed an efficient
system of administration, hence he is considered as the founder
of a political system in Islam. He imposed Divine Law as the code of a
newly formed International Islamic State; He safeguarded the internal safety
by introducing the police force: He gave stipends to the poor. He constructed headquarters and forts
for the safety of Islamic armies. He founded new cities for the growth
of Islamic culture and civilization. He improved agriculture and
economics of the Islamic State. He founded the educational system
within the Islamic State as well. In short, Umar(Radhiallahu anhu) is the
role model for every Muslim. He was an embodiment of justice,
 principles,piety, humility, and character. He performed all his roles whether personal or professional 
with intensity and not a single example can be put forward
 which shows that he performed his role less than perfect."
"Uncle, I am here. Come on let us go home. Okay, Uncle. Can you please tell me the remaining story
 of Ammar (Rali Allahu Anhu)? Sure. Inshallah, I will tell
you the remaining story now.. Bismillahirrahmanirrahim The Story of Hazrat Ammar Ibn
Yasir (Rali Allahu Anhu) The parents of Ammar (Rali Allahu Anhu)
were killed by the enemies, right infront of his eyes. They were killed as they were not ready
 to leave their faith in Allah. Ammar(Rali Allahu Anhu) had to
 praise their idols to save himself from the 
torture of the enemies. Only after he praised the pagan gods
 did they release him from chains. When they released Him, Ammar ran
towards the house of the Prophet. Once he met the Prophet, he started
weeping infront of him like a little kid. He did not weep for his parents or for
himself or for the torture he had suffered. He wept because he
praised the pagan idols. With great compassion, Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) consoled Ammar(Rali Allahu Anhu) However, he could not control his pain
and he continued to weep. He asked for forgiveness for making the
mistake of praising the pagan idols. With his great kindness, the Prophet
 Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) asked him about his faith in his heart. He replied that he had firm faith in Allah and great love towards the Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) in his heart. The Prophet asked him not to worry and wiped off his tears
as he still had a great faith towards Allah in his heart  even after all these tortures. The condition of the Muslims
in Mecca became very critical. It was very difficult to survive
in Mecca due to the enemies. So, the Prophet(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) ordered his companions to immigrate
to Yathrib. Ammar (Rali Allahu Anhu) was one
of those who migrated first. Later the Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) also immigrated to Yathrib and
joined the companions. They lived there peacefully and happily
with their brothers in Yathrib. The Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)  decided to build a mosque in Yathirb  so that the Muslims could worship there. This news was received with
great excitement,  and they started building this mosque. They did everything themselves
to build the Mosque. Some Muslims carried the dust,
some were making bricks, and some were carrying the dried
 bricks to make the walls. Everyone contributed
whole heartedly. The Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) worked with his companions
to build the mosque as well. Ammar’s enthusiasm was much
more that others who worked. He worked hard a lot than
others to build the mosque. He was covered completely with dust, always, due to his hard work. While everyone carried one brick at a time,
Ammar used to carry two bricks at a time. The Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) started noticing the enthusiasm and
 hard work of Ammar(Rali Allahu Anhu) Seeing this, with great compassion
 the Prophet told him that when everyone get a reward, Ammar will be entitled
for two rewards! Ammar used to tell everyone that people
 who worked to build the mosque, toiling hard and getting
 their clothes dirty, are much better when compared to
those who just stood and watched. Some companions were avoiding dust. They became displeased
with Ammar's words. One companion came to Ammar
and threatened him to hit his nose if he repeated the
 same words again. Ammar felt really sad. He just looked at that companion
but did not say a word. The Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) felt sad when he heard about this incident. With great pain in his heart, the Prophet Muhammad 
(Sallallhu alaihi wasallam) walked towards Ammar(Rali Allahu Anhu) and said that he was very dear to him  and close to his heart. The Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
then rubbed off the dust from Ammar’s face. Ammar truly felt the Prophet's
kindness at that moment. Days and months passed. It so happened that the enemies of the
 prophet startedstealing money and other belongings of Muslims. The enemies had by now assembled
an army to confront the Muslims. When the news reached the Prophet, he
quickly called for a meeting with Sahabas. The Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
 was not interested in any violence, but after that meeting, He couldn’t find any
other solution. The Prophet Muhammad(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
decided to confront their enemy. But no one was ready to go to
enemy camp to gather information. So the Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahi alaihi wasallam) asked Ammar (Rali Allahu Anhu) if he was
willing to go to the enemy camp. Ammar (Rali Allahu Anhu) was a brave man,
and readily agreed. He approached the enemy camps and
went around collecting information. He reported back to the Prophet
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) the next morning, and gave him all the information. The Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu
 alaihi wasallam) was very happy because Ammar(Rali Allahu Anhu) had collected all the required information. On the morning of 17th Ramadan, 
the great Battle of Badr, the first battle in the history
 of Islam broke out. The Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
led the battle successfully, and by the grace of Allah,
 the Muslims won this battle. There are many incidents where the
 Prophet praised Hazrat Ammar Ibn Yasir regarding his glorious deeds. Once he said that Ammar was
 filled with faith from the crown of his head
 to the soles of his feet. In another incident,  Prophet Muhammad(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
 said about Ammar(Rali Allahu Anhu) “Ammar is with the truth and the
 truth is with Ammar. He turns wherever
the truth turns. Ammar is as near to me as
an eye is near to the nose. Alas, a rebellious
group will kill him.” Days, months and years passed. Hazrat Ammar Ibn Yasir (Rali Allahu Anhu) was one of the most trusted and loyal companion of Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). He was always seen with the Prophet and he always strived for Allah against the
 enemies of Islam and humanity. When the Prophet passed away,
Ammar wept over his old friend. He cried like a child
for many days. When Umar bin al-Khattab became
 the second Caliph, he appointed Ammar to rule
 over Kufa in Iraq. In Kufa, Ammar(Rali Allahu Anhu)  treated
 people according to Allah’s law. The people were pleased with his
just, merciful and humble treatment. Hazrat Ammar Ibn Yasir died at
 the age of ninety six, in a battle ground at the hands of enemies, just like the Prophet Muhammad 
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) had predicted. What are you thinking Abu? Mashallah, That was
such a lovely story. He loved the Prophet (Sallallahu alaihi
wasallam) than anything else in his life. Yes, you are right. I am glad that you
liked the story. I will tell you
another one tomorrow."
"Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam!
Don’t you have school today? No uncle, its holiday for us. Can you please tell me
a story today uncle? I am so happy to see your enthusiasm.  You can learn so much from the life of the Companions
of Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam), It will help you lead your life in a positive way. That is correct uncle. Which story are you going to tell me today? Inshallah, I will tell you the story of Syed
 Ibn Aamir Al-Jumahi (Rali Allahu Anhu) The Story of Syed Ibn Aamir
 Al-Jumahi (Rali Allahu Anhu) Syed Ibn Aamir Al-Jumahi(Rali Allahu Anhu) was one of the companions of the Prophet
 Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). He was not a Muslim by birth. He left his home, which was in the region of Tarim,  along with hundreds of others to
 witness the end of the Sahabi Khubaib Ibn Adiy (Rali Allahu Anhu ). Khubaib Ibn Adiy (Rali Allahu Anhu) was
an earlier entrant to Islam The great Sahabi was
captured by the enemies. The enemy decided to take the life 
of this noble personality  in the presence of all the people of Makkah. This way they could make
an example out of him. They also meant it as a warning for those
who were planning to join the Prophet. The were called to witness the death  they had to face if they abandoned 
the religion of their ancestors. When Syed Ibn Aamir Al-Jumahi
witnessed the proceedings, he was impressed with the strong faith and the fearless attitude of Khubaib
 Ibn Adiy (Rali Allahu Anhu). He acted as a man of faith even when he saw the death right 
in front of his eyes.  He was never shaken and he
 faced the death with a smile. In that moment the people gathered 
around  realized that Khubaib Ibn Adiy (Rali Allahu Anhu) was receiving enormous strength from Allah. The vibrant, youthful and intelligent
Syed (Rali Allahu Anhu) was caught in the ripples of
that great event. The death of Khubaib (Rali Allahu Anhu) and his heroic response in defense,  moved the young Syed Ibn Aamir
 (Rali Allahu Anhu). The faith expressed by Khubaib
 (Rali Allahu Anhu) attracted him to Islam and its studies. After accepting Islam, Syed ibn Aamir (Rali Allahu Anhu) migrated to Medina and attached himself to the Prophet
 Muhammad(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). He showed great interest in
 studying the Holy Quran, and in living life as per the instructions of the
 Prophet Muhammad(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) He was the Governor of Homs in Syria during
the caliphate of Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu). Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu) appointed him as 
governor of Homs (Emessa) in Syria. Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu) once
called him and said: ‘I appoint you as the
governor of Homs. Syed Amir (Rali Allahu Anhu) said: ‘Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu), I beg you in
the name of Allah (Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala), Do not cause me to go astray by
involving me in worldly affairs’. Umar Al Khattab (Rali Allahu Anhu)
became somewhat angry. He said: ""You people have placed the responsibility
 of caliphate on me  and now you are leaving me alone
 in this great matter"". He replied quickly: ""By Allah! I will
never forsake you"". In this way Syed Ibn Amir Al Jumah
 (Rali Allahu Anhu) became the governor of Homs in Syria. Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu) then asked him
 about the salary he required.  He asked: What should I give
you as a salary?"" He was very much disturbed
by that question. He did not want him to associate
with the worldly attraction. Hence he said to Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu): ""What would I do with it,
Commander of the Faithful? What would be given to me from the treasury
would exceed my needs,"" he answered. The Caliph was very much impressed
with his reply, and bid him farewell. Homs was a big city that
witnessed one after the other, the rise and extinction
of many civilizations. Besides, it was a vital trade center too. Syed (Rali Allahu Anhu) tried to live
 the most humble way. He was not a conventional
governor, as people thought. Once during a visit to Homs, Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu) asked
the people of Homs  if they had any complaints against
their governor. The people then informed the Caliph about the four
 major weakness their governor had, which required his urgent attention. When Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu)
arrived at the office,  he summoned Syed (Rali Allahu Anhu ),
 and in his presence, he asked the representatives of Homs
to state their complaints. The first complaint that people had was that he left his home very late
 in the mornings. Syed (Rali Allahu Anhu) replied that it was because after
his morning prayers, he read the Quran. And since he didn’t want any servants, he had to assist his wife in preparing the meals, and do other chores which
took a lot of time. Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu)'s face brightened  when he heard this and said  “All praises and thanks to Allah” The second complaint that arose was that
he did not attend anyone during night. Syed (Rali Allahu Anhu) explained that he
reserved the night for his prayers, like how he reserved his day
 for the people, and that’s why he didn’t attend
anyone during the night. The Caliph was satisfied
with his reply again The third complaint was that he was not
available for two days in every month, in which he doesn’t
leave the house at all. To this Syed (Rali Allahu Anhu) replied that it was because he had only
 two pairs of garment,  and he had to wash and dry them. Only after wearing them he was able to 
leave the house again. When Umar (Rali Alahu Anhu) heard this,
 his face brightened The fourth complaint was that he occasionally
fell into fits of unconsciousness. Syed(Rali Allahu Anhu) explained  that he was a witness of the
martyr of Khubai Al-Ansaari in Makkah, and he could do nothing to help him.  Whenever he recollected the incident, he feared the punishment of Allah,  and that’s why he faints. Saying this, he bowed his head 
and stood silently, waiting for the Caliph’s verdict. There was nothing more to be said except what Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu) 
said in response  “Alhamdullilah!  All praises and thanks to Allah”  He then told everyone that the governors
 todays lived like kings. They filled their stomach with food,
while their people were hungry. He then requested the people gathered 
around to learn from their governor's life,  as that is how a Muslim should live. The piety, honesty and dedication of Syed
 Ibn Amir Al Jumahi (Rali Allahu Anhu )  earned him the love and respect
 from every one. He had dusty uncombed hair. Nothing in his looks or appearance
distinguished him from the poor Muslims. Once some of the officials from
 Homs visited  Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu) They were people of integrity who had earned the
confidence of Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu) and he respected them a lot. During the converstion
 Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu)  requested them to write down the names 
of the poor ones in their province so that some money and material could be 
sent for their relief. While checking the list  Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu) was surprised to
 see the name of the governor of Homs,  mentioned in the list! When he asked them about this, they said it had been several days that this man  had been living without a fire
 being lit in his house. When the Caliph heard this, he was
greatly moved and he started weeping. He arranged 1000 dinars in a purse and asked them to give this money
 to relieve his needs. Umar (Rali Allahu Anhu)
 said to the officials: ‘Convey my Salam to
Syed Al-Jumahi (Rali Allahu Anhu) and tell him that Amir of the Muslims
 sent him this money  to relieve
his needs’.  The officials agreed, and visited the
 house of Syed (Rali Allahu Anhu) When the officials handed over
 the purse to him,  he opened it and found that it 
was filled with money. He rejected this gift at first, but somehow the officials managed
 to hand over this money. When his wife saw the
money, she said to him “Please buy us some provisions,
and hire us a maid!” “Shall I get you something
better than that?” he asked her. “What could be that?” she asked On the spot, he divided the
 money into portions, and sent someone in his household  to distribute  it among widows,
 orphans, and the poor. He was a great sage and one of the
most sincere heirs to Allah’s Rasul. He lived his life truly, heeding the words of the Prophet 
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). That’s right. I am really surprised to hear the
way he dealt with his wealth. He could have been
a rich person. True. However, he was a wise man and
he had enough wisdom to realize that the real reward for him
will be given at Heaven. Inshallah, I will tell you the
story of another Sahabi tomorrow.. May Allah bless you!"
"Abu Bakr(Rali Allahu Anhu)
 was born in Mecca, a Quraishi of the Banu Taim clan. Abu Bakr, which means 'The Owner
of Camels' was not his real name. He acquired this name later in life because
of his great interest in raising camels. His real name was Abdul Ka'aba, which means 'Slave of Ka'aba'. It was Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) who later changed it to Abdullah, which means 'Slave of God'. The Prophet also gave him the title of
'Siddiq' - 'The Testifier to the Truth.' Abu Bakr was a fairly
wealthy merchant, and before he embraced Islam, was a respected
citizen of Mecca. He was three years younger
than the Prophet. But they were always seen together
from earliest child hood. He remained the closest Companion of the
Prophet all through the Prophet's life. When Prophet first invited his closest
friends and relatives to Islam, Abu Bakr was among the
first to accept it. He also persuaded Uthman and Bilal to
 accept Islam,among many others. In the early days of
the Prophet's mission, when the handful of Muslims were subjected
to relentless persecution and torture, Abu Bakr bore his full
share of hardship. Finally when Allah (Subhanahu wa ta'ala)instructed
 the Prophet to emigrate from Mecca, he was the one chosen by the
Prophet to accompany him on the dangerous
journey to Medina. In the numerous battles which took
place during the life of the Prophet, Abu Bakr was always by his side. Once, he brought all his
belongings to the Prophet, who was raising money for
the defense of Medina. The Prophet asked ""Abu Bakr, what did you
leave for your family?"" The reply came:
""God and His Prophet."" Such was his devotion
to Prophet and Islam. Even before accepting Islam, Abu Bakr(Radi Allahu Anhu) was known to be
a man of upright character, amicable and compassionate nature. All through his life he was sensitive
to human suffering  and kind to the poor and helpless. Even though he was wealthy, he lived very simply and spent
his wealth for charity, for freeing slaves and
for the cause of Islam. He often spent part of the night
in supplication and prayer. He shared with his family a cheerful
and affectionate home life. The Prophet's closest
Companion, Abu Bakr, was not present when the Holy
Prophet breathed his last. When he came to know of
the Prophet's passing, Abu Bakr hurried to
the house of sorrow. ""How blessed was your life and
how beatific is your death,"" he whispered as he kissed the cheek of his
beloved friend and master who now was no more. When Abu Bakr came out of the Prophet's
apartment and broke the news, disbelief and dismay gripped the
community of Muslims in Medina. Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu
alaihi wasallam) had been the leader, the guide and the bearer of Divine revelation through
whom they had been brought from idolatry and barbarism into the way of God. How could he die? Even Umar, one of the bravest and the
strongest of the Prophet's Companions, lost his composure and drew his sword and
threatened to kill anyone  who said that the Prophet was dead. Abu Bakr gently
pushed him aside, ascended the steps of the lectern in the
mosque and addressed the people, saying, ""O people, verily whoever worshiped
Muhammad, behold! Muhammad is indeed dead. But whoever worships
God, behold! God is alive and
will never die."" And then he concluded with
a verse from the Qur'an: ""And Muhammad is
but a Messenger. Many Messengers have
gone before him; if then he dies or is killed, will you turn back upon your heels?"" On hearing these words,
the people were consoled. Despondency gave place to
confidence and tranquility. This critical moment had passed. But the Muslim community was now faced
with an extremely serious problem: that of choosing a leader. After some discussion among
the Companions of the Prophet who had assembled in order
to select a leader, it became apparent that no one was better suited for
this responsibility than Abu Bakr. As the news of the
Prophet's death spread, a number of the tribes rebelled
and refused to pay Zakat, this was due only to the
Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him). At the same time a number of
impostors claimed false prophethood, and they started revolting. To add to all this, two powerful empires, of the
Eastern Roman and the Persian, also threatened the new-born
Islamic state at Medina. Many companions of the Prophet,
including Umar(Radi Allahu Anhu), advised Abu Bakr to make concessions to
the Zakat evaders, at least for a time. The new Caliph disagreed. He insisted that the Divine
Law cannot be divided, that there is no distinction between
the obligations of Zakat and Salat and that any compromise
with the injunctions of God would eventually erode the
foundations of Islam. Umar and others were quick to
realize their error of judgment. The revolting tribes soon attacked
Medina, but the Muslims were prepared. Abu Bakr(Radi Allahu Anhu) himself
led the charge, forcing them to retreat. He then made a relentless war on the
false claimants to prophet hood, and when they were defeated,
they again professed lslam. The threat from the Roman Empire had actually arisen earlier,
during the Prophet's lifetime. The Prophet had organized an
army under the command of Usama, the son of a freed slave. The army had not gone far when the
Prophet had fallen ill so they stopped. After the death of the Prophet the
 question was raised whether the army should be sent again
or should remain for the defence of Medina. Again Abu Bakr showed a firm
determination and he said, ""I shall send Usama's army on its way
as ordered by the Prophet, even if I am left alone."" The final instructions he gave to Usama
prescribed a code of conduct in war which remains unsurpassed to this day. Part of his instructions
to the Muslim army were: ""Do not be deserters, nor
be guilty of disobedience. Do not kill an old man,
a woman or a child. Do not injure date palms and
do not cut down fruit trees. Do not slaughter any sheep or cows
or camels except for food. You will encounter persons who
spend their lives in monasteries. Leave them alone and
do not molest them."" Khalid bin Waleed had been chosen by the Prophet
on several occasions to lead Muslim armies. A man of supreme courage
and born a leader, his military genius came to a full flower
during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr. Throughout Abu Bakr's reign Khalid led his troops from one victory to
 another against the attacking Romans. Another contribution of Abu
Bakr to the cause of Islam was the collection and compilation
of the verses of the Qur'an. Abu Bakr died on 21st Jamadi-al Akhir,
13 A.H. ( 634 A.C.), at the age of sixty-three, and was buried by the side of the
Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him). His caliphate had been of a mere
twenty-seven months duration. In this brief span, however, Abu Bakr had managed,
by the Grace of God, to strengthen and consolidate
his community and the state, and to secure the Muslims
 against the perils which had threatened their existence."
"Assalamu Alaikum Walaikum Assalam Uncle, which story are you
going to tell me today? Hmmm.  Inshallah, I will tell you the
story of our first Muezzin of Islam today Huh? Who was he Uncle? His name was Hazrat Bilal Ibn Rabah
(Rali Allahu Anhu) Please tell his story uncle Alright, now listen carefully! Bismillahirrahmanirrahim The Story of Hazrat Bilal ibn
Rabah (Rali Allahu Anhu) Hazrat Bilal (Rali Allahu Anhu) or
 Bilal Ibn Rabah or sometimes known as “Bilal the Ethiopian” 
was the first Muezzin of Islam. Muezzin or Muazzin is a chosen
 person at the mosque  who leads the Azaan to five daily prayers 
and to the Friday service. He was originally a black slave
 from Ethiopia. He was one of the most trusted and loyal companion
 of Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) Hazrat Bilal is very lovingly remembered
 by Muslims around the world as one of the earliest 
great African Muslim. He was born in a village in a
mountainous place in Western Arabia. Bilal’s father was called Rabah and his mother was known as Hamamah. They had come to Arabia
as slaves from Ethiopia. The father and mother were slaves of 
Umayyah ibn Khalaf ibn Safwan,  a rich man from the tribe of Quraish. Bilal was therefore born in
slavery and served his master. Hazrat Bilal (Rali Allahu Anhu)
was the first to accept Islam. He had a strong faith in
 Allah (Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala) and great love for our Prophet Hazrat 
Muhammad Mustafa(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) He had a pure character. Soon after converting to Islam  he earned high respect of 
our Holy Prophet. Prophet liked Bilal’s sweet voice and made
 him the first Muazzin of Islam - The caller to the Prayers. Here is the moral story of
 Islam’s first muezzin, Hazrat Bilal’s conversion to Islam. Before joining the Prophet,
Bilal was a slave of Umayyah. One day, as usual Bilal came back
from work after feeding the sheep. He was really tired and desperately
wanted to take some rest. He had been grazing the sheep under the hot
sun of Arabian desert the whole afternoon. Just as he was about to take some rest,
he heard loud shouts of his master. His master Umayyah was a leading member of 
Quraish clan and the head of bani Jumah. Bilal wanted to know what was going on,  but he was afraid of getting close
 enough to Master’s room. His master was a cruel man, and
he always treated Bilal harshly. When he reached the window, he saw his master standing along with 
other aristocrats of Makkah. He could see that all of them were very upset. The voice of terribly upset
 Umayyah raised again “We must not let Muhammad
disturb the city like this. He treated our idols
with disrespect. He says there is only one God
and everybody must worship him. Do you know what that means? It means that Me,  a noble person of Makkah and Bilal, my ignorant black slave,
 must have the same god? Isnt it ridiculous?  How can that be possible? Then the other aristrocat answered “We have fell into a terrible misfortune. Everybody knows about the
character of Muhammad. He is well known for his
truthfulness and trustworthiness” Then Umayyah replied “Then we have to
convince everyone that He has gone mad” Other aristocrats present there
thought it was a good idea. They accepted this suggestion,
and went back to their homes. Bilal couldn’t get
much sleep that night. He kept thinking about
the words of his master. He knew that Prophet Muhammad
would only say the truth. “Was it why the aristocrats
in Makkah turn against him?” He was worried if the people would start
believing in the plans his master made. He knew that Prophet was the most innocent,
trustworthy and truthful man in Makkah. If he said that there is only one God, then those Gods are not the idols, 
then he certainly was telling the truth. He kept wondering why were the aristocrats
and masters afraid of Prophet’s preaching. The following day, Bilal the Ethiopian
heard people talking about the Prophet. They were saying that
Prophet had gone mad! He tried to speak to them several times trying to 
convince them that it was not the truth.  But nobody believed him. Days passed one after the other. Every day there was some or the other
news about the Prophet on the streets. There was news about one or more men
being added to the Prophet's followers. There were also news about the followers
of Islam being injured or killed. He started worrying
about the prophet. He was unable to do anything and 
soon his sadness turned to anger. “I will revenge these
cruelties” he said to himself. One day he heard the news of
 Ammar ibn Yasir’s father and mother being martyred 
at the hands of Abu Jahl. Bilal knew Ammar ibn Yasir. He was one of the innocent
and honest youth in Makkah. Bilal also knew Abu Jahl, the
master of Ammar ibn Yasir. Abu Jahl was one of the aristocrats of
Makkah who was famous for his cruelty. Bilal soon arrived
at a decision. One day while coming back from work, instead of going to his master's house, he went directly to the house of the
Prophet Muhammad(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) It was then that he saw the
 Messenger of God, Holy Prophet Muhammad 
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). Bilal saw that He was a tall man,
with a face shining with faith. When Bilal saw him, he knew that
his heart had found its lost hope. Prophet spoke to
Bilal for some time. Bilal did not want
to leave from there. He decided to become Muslim at the
 hands of Messenger of God,  and declared his submission to Islam. Bilal and other followers of Islam kept meeting
under the cover of darkness during the nights. The words of the Prophet had
changed their lives completely. They no longer believed in 
worshipping the idols  because they had now learned about
 Allah (Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala) That’s all Abu. Next time,I will tell you another story Thanks. Massalam Yusuf Uncle May Allah bless you. Ma assalam Abu."
"Asalamu Alaikum uncle. Waalaikum Assalam Abu. Come sit here Uncle, Can you tell me the story
of another Sahabah today? I’m so glad that you are
loving the stories Abu! Yes uncle. I just
love their stories Inshallah, in that case, I will tell you
the story of Abuzar Al Ghaffari (Rali Allahu Anhu) today The Story of Abuzar
Al Ghaffari (Rali Allahu Anhu) Abuzar Al Ghaffari (Rali Allahu Anhu) was one of the companions of the Prophet
 Muhammad (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam). He was one of the first few people
who got converted into Islam. He was born to the Ghifar clan, found in the South west of Medina. It is said that, his tribe lived by
attacking and stealing from caravans. However, unlike others he preferred to live
as a poor, but honest life of a shepherd. Abuzar was a truth seeker
from his childhood. He was most unhappy about the custom
 of Idol-worship that was quiet common in Arabia
 during the 7th century. He had already believed in a Supreme God  and he used to spend most of his time
 reflecting on that. The news of the Prophet Muhammad
(Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)'s mission spread in Arabia, and it also arrived in the tribe of Ghifar. Abuzar too heard about the
 Prophet’s mission. When he heard this, he realized that this
was the person he was searching for. He asked his brother
to go to Hijaz. He asked him to find more details
about the prophet and his mission. His brother went to Makakh, and
gathered the news as he wanted. Abuzar found the news and the report
from his brother very encouraging. Hazrat Abuzar Ghaffari (Rali Allahu Anhu) then decided to
meet the Prophet Muhammad (SA) personally. This was the time when Islam had
only a handful of followers. He travelled to Makkah, and went to meet
 the Prophet Sallallahu alaihi wasallam He first met with Imam Ali bin AbuTalib
who introduced Him to Abu Talib. Abu Talib took Him to Hazrat
Hamza(Rali Allahu Anhu) After a thorough security check,  Abuzar was finally introduced to the Prophet  Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). The moment he met the Prophet
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam), he gave a Salam to the Prophet
Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). This was long before the times when Islamic
Salam was introduced into the culture. Abuzar(Rali Allahu Anhu) was very
 impressed by the charm, and the kindness of the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). He said to the Prophet: ""I bear witness that there is
 no god but Allah and Mohammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam)
 is His Servant and Messenger"" He and his brother
then embraced Islam. He had the exclusive honor to call the
Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahi alaihi wasallam) as Ya Habibi means my dear friend,  while everybody else could only address him as Ya Rasool Allah. Hazrat Abuzar Al Ghaffari (Rali Allahu Anhu)
stayed in Makkah for few days. During those few days, he made a couple
of speeches in the temple grounds. Whenever he did that, he was immediately
 surrounded by the enemies  and was beaten up by them. It was Al-Abbas ibn Abdul Mutalib,
the uncle of the Prophet, who often came to his rescue. All the incidents were reported
to the Prophet in detail. One day, the Prophet called him and advised
him to go back to his tribe of Ghaffar. He asked him to stay there until he
established a community in Medina. Abuzar refused to go back at first, but when the Prophet persisted, he agreed. He returned to his land,
 and under his influence,  his whole family got converted
 to Islam as well! Hazrat Abuzar Ghaffari (Rali Allahu Anhu)  has had the reputation of being an 
outspoken man  as he always spoke his mind out. He was never afraid of the
consequences he had to face. He and his brother started speaking about
their new faith among his tribesmen. The young men of the tribe did not like this new faith of
 Abu Zar (Rali allahu Anhu) and his brother. So they started to show their
 anger towards them. When they could bear no more, the issue
was reported to the chief of the tribe. Abuzar (Rali Allahu Anhu) had a lot of
respect among the tribesmen. When the chief called him and his brother, they both went to appear before him. He questioned Abu Zar (Rali Allahu Anhu)  and his brother about the trouble that
 both of them had started. Abuzar (Rali  Allahu Anhu) pleaded
 his case with proper reasons but with due respect
 and compassion. The chief listened to what
Abuzar was saying for a long time. Then they discussed about
his new faith for a while. After this long discussion, the chief of the tribe announced that he
 too was going to convert to Islam!. All the people in the tribe
were shocked by this incident! They realized that there was
something special going on here, so they went to Abuzar to discuss
about the Prophet and his messages. Many number of people were convinced,  following which, a great number of 
young men accepted Islam after that turn of events. Abuzar (Rali Allahu Anhu) continued to
 teach Islam to his people. During those few years in Madina, Abuzar(Rali Allahu Anhu) became very
 friendly with Imam Ali bin AbuTalib. The four people named Salman
 al-Farsi (Rali Allahu Anhu), Abuzar Ghaffari (Rali Allahu Anhu), Miqdad bin Aswad (Rali Allahu Anhu) and Ammar Yasir(Rali Allahu Anhu) were always seen in the company
 of Imam Ali bin AbuTalib. In the 9th year of Hijra, the Prophet
 Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) prepared a large campaign to
confront the Romans,  who were planning to attack them. The Prophet then decided
to travel towards Tabuk. Imam Ali bin AbuTalib was appointed
as the administrator of Medina. Abuzar (Rali Allahu Anhu) also accompanied
the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). They arranged the camels, and
loaded them with their goods. The next day, they started their journey.  However, Abuzar (Rali Allahu Anhu)'s
camel was very old and weak. His camel could not keep up
with the rest of the group. Finally, when he was left behind
 by a great distance,  he left the camel, carried his things in a bag,
 and started walking. The people noticed that Abuzar
(Rali Allahu Anhu) had been left behind, and they went searching for him  Finally when they saw
him, they found him walking alone,  carrying his huge bag. They returned to the Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) and reported that what they saw. The Prophet looked at Abuzar
 (Rali Allahu Anhu) approaching them from a distance, and said: ""This is Abuzar, my Sahabi. He is walking alone,  he will live alone, and one day,
die alone. A group of strangers from Iraq will take
 care of his funeral and bury him."" Abuzar (Rali Allahu Anhu) saw his
people waiting for him, he joined them and continued
 with his journey. Abuzar(Rali Allahu Anhu) lived a pious life and He spent His days in prayer and worship His meagre daily meals included
just a handful of dates. Once someone asked him  why he was always
seen wearing a single pair of clothes. Abuzar (Rali Allahu Anhu) replied: I had another pair of clothes. But I saw someone who
needed it more than I did. How could I keep a second pair of clothes while there was another person who
 did not have even one? That reply surprised the man. He realized that Abuzar (Rali Allahu Anhu)
was a great humanitarian  and at the same time a simple man too. Once the Amir of Syria sent him
300 dinars to meet his needs. However, he rejected that money and returned the money to Amir’s
 servant and said: Why Amir did not find a servant
more deserving of it than me?” Abu Zar (Rali Allahu Anhu) lived
a simple life, and dedicated himself to
Allah until he died In the final days of his
life, he moved to Rabza. He stayed in Rabza until the
 time of his death. He only had his daughter along with him. When his daughter saw that her 
father was soon going to die, she expressed her concerns over
her security. She was worried that there will be no one
 to protect her from the wilder beasts. However, he had a
great faith in Allah. He said to his daughter: “Do not be afraid,  in a few moments some believing
men would arrive here  to help us before I die”. After some time his daughter saw
some men walking towards their home. She ran to her father
and informed him. He insisted her not to leave the
men without serving the meal. He then asked her to help him to
face towards the Qibla.  And that day, he took his last breath. The believing men took his daughter
 along with them after having the meals as insisted by
Abuzar(Rali Allahu Anhu). Hazrat Abu Zar (Rali Allahu Anhu) died
alone in exile with no one by his side,  just like as the Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam) predicted. Abuzar (Rali Allahu Anhu) is considered
 as one of the greatest and the most loyal companion of the Prophet
 Muhammad (Sallallahu alaihi wasallam). That’s all Abu. Next time I will tell you another story. Mashallah, he was truly
a loyal companion. That’s all Abu.  Next time I will tell you another story. Thanks.
 Ma as-salama Yousuf Uncle. May Allah bless you. Ma as- salama Abu."
"""Enlightenment of the Prophet"" The holy Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu
Alaihi Wasallam was happily married to Khadija. She was the best of all women
in terms of her excellent morals, Manners, and appreciation of the prophet. Khadija led a happy life with the prophet
and she gave birth to four girls and two boys. The boys were Al Qasim and Abdullah who by Allah's will died young one after the other. As four of the girls they had a happy childhood
with their kind father and their noble mother. Even though the prophet was mourning
the loss of his sons he kept himself busy handling the trade. It was the tough time to live in Arabia. There were frequent wars among
 different communities with Arabia. And things were no different in Mecca. The different clans and tribes in Mecca
fought among themselves. The prophet didn't join any of them And neither did he join any rebellion. He believed that there was
only one Allah. Creator of the sun, the moon, the earth,
the sky, and of all living things. And that all people should worship
only him. He would often leave the crowded city
and go to the cave in mount Hira. This was the period of confusion in
Prophet's life. He wondered what was life's purpose. His visits to Mount Hira
became more frequent. And he would spend the nights contemplating The daughters of the prophet had grown up. And they soon got married. The prophet was very close to his
youngest daughter, Fathima. Fathima was a darling to her mother as well He often used to discuss his concerns
with his wife. But she assured him that God wouldn't
let anything bad happen to him. She asked him to trust God
and his plans. In his fortieth year prophet left mecca to spend Ramadan The traditional month of retreat
 in the cave. In the second half of Ramadan Allah began to reveal his message for
mankind through the prophet. The first revelation occurred as follows One day as usual, The prophet was sitting in the cave. He suddenly saw a strange light
in the shape of a man standing before him. It was none other than the anger Gabriel. The angel then commanded the
prophet to read. The prophet replied that he was illiterate and so could not read. At this instant The angel grabbed the prophet
in his arms and pressed him to his chest until it was almost too much to bare. He then released him and said again Read. I can not, replied the prophet. The angel embraced him again. For the third time, the angel commanded
the prophet to read. But still he said he could not. And was again embraced. On releasing him this time However the angel said Read in the name of your lord who has created everything who has created men from a clay. Read! And your lord is the most generous. The prophet repeated this verses just as the angel had said him. When the angel was sure the prophet knew
them by heart he went away. The prophet was alone now. And couldn't understand what just happened. He was terribly afraid and rushed
out of the cave. He was shivering in cold as he run
towards his home. In a state of confusion he returned
home to Khadija. When his wife saw him
she became very worried. Her husband was shivering as dove in fever. He asked her to wrap him in blankets. Which she did. After a while he recovered sufficiently to
tell her what had happened at Hira. Khadija believed all that he told her. And with great respect said Be happy. And be confident. Truly I swear by Allah who has my soul in his hands that you will be our people's prophet. The messenger of Allah was eased by her face in him. But after all that had happened he was exhausted. Khadija left the prophet sleeping. And went to see her cousin Waraqah ibn Nawfal to ask him what he thought about
all that had happened. He was an old man who had excellent
knowledge of scriptures. But he was blind. Khadija said to Waraqah Listen to the story of my husband Oh my cousin! Waraqah asked her to narrate what happened. Khadija then describe the prophet's
encounter with the angel exactly as he told her. She told him how the angel
asked him to read. And how he pressed him when he told
he can't read. She also told him what the angels said
before leaving the prophet. As Waraqah listened to the incidents he began to tremble in excitement. He told Khadija that the prophet had been chosen
by Allah to be his messenger. Just as the angel Gabriel had come to
prophet Musa Alaihis Salam before and ordered him to guide his people. So her husband too would be
the prophet of his people. But Waraqah warned that not all the people would listen
to the prophet. And some would mistreat his followers. He must however be patient. Because he had a great message for
all the world. He told her that if he were to
live long enough then he would forever stand and
support of the prophet. Khadija was satisfied with her cousin's
answers and returned. But after a few days Waraqah died. And the divine inspiration was also
paused for a while. Angel Gabriel came often to the prophet. And the verses he taught him, the message
from Allah to men were later written down and are known to us as the Holy Quran. After that momentous day in
 the month of Ramadan revelation came again and again
to the prophet. He understood now what he had to do and
prepared himself for what was to come. Only a strong and brave men helped by Allah can be a true prophet. Because people often refused to listen
to Allah's message. Khadija Radi Allahu Anha was the first
to believe the prophet and accept the truth. And Waraqah was the second person
to believe in him. Through her Allah made things easier for the prophet. Khadija strengthened him helped him spread his message and stood up
to the people who were against him."
"""The Troubles Begin"" It is well known that Mecca was the
center for the Arabs. And house the custodians of Caba. Protection and guardianship of the idols
and stone raven images lay in the hands of the Meccans. It was very difficult to preach
about one true God in a place considered the den of idolatry. Working in such an atmosphere no doubt
requires unshakable will and determination. That is why the call into Islam
had to be done secretly. The Meccans should not be enriched by
 the unexpected surprise. The mission of the Prophet Sallallahu
 Alaihi Wasallam started right from his own home and then moved to the people closely
associated with him. Khadija Radi Allahu Anha the prophet's spouse, the mother of believers was the first to enter the fold of Islam. This was followed by his freed slave
Zayd ibn Haritha. His cousin Ali Ibn Abu Talib who had been living with him since
his early childhood. And next came his intimate friend Abu Bakr As Sadir Radi Allahu Anha which meant Abu Bakr, the truth verifier. And they all were the first muslims. There is also another opinion which says
that all four of them accepted Islam on the same day When Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala
send the second revelation. They stood by the prophet and helped him
in spreading Islam. Abu Bakr Radi Allahu Anha embraced Islam. And from the very first day he proved to be an energetic and
most zealous activist He was wealthy obliging mild and upright. People used to frequent his house his knowledge amity pleasant company and business. The number of people following the prophet
began to grow. Sometimes they would all go
out of the city to the mountains around Mecca to hear him recite the Quran and to be taught by him. This was all done very secretly. And only a few people know about Islam
in those early days. Even though a secret the news leaked out and was soon known
to many people in Mecca. The Meccan leaders did not care much
about Muhammad and took no heed of his teachings. But this attitude of indifference soon changed into real fear and anger. Leaders from different tribes including Quraysh started observing
the prophet closely. They feared the prophet's reputation and his influence over the people of Mecca. For full three years prophet was condemned to teach with in
 a rather narrow circle. The time had however come to preach the faith
 of the lord openly. One day, Gabriel Alaihi Salaam came to the prophet and ordered him
to start preaching openly to everyone. The prophet told the people of Mecca  that he had something very important
 to tell them. He stood in a hill side in Mecca called Safa. And they gathered around to hear
what he had to say. They answered that indeed they would because he never lied. He then told them that he was
the messenger of Allah send to show them the right way. And to warn them of
terrible punishments if they did not follow him in worshiping
only Allah and none other. Abu Lahab one of the prophet's uncles who was
among the listeners suddenly stood up. He warned the people gathered there of the dare consequences that one may
have to face if they listen to the prophet. The prophet was silent. And did not command anything. The people present there got terrified and they immediately left. The prophet was left alone
in the valley. A few days later the prophet tried again. A feast was prepared in his house
for all of his relatives. After the meal he stood up and spoke to the people. He told them about the one true God. And why everyone should believe in him. He told them that Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala
had chosen him as the messenger. And that they should listen to
what he had to say. All the men kept silent. Then Ali, his cousin jumped up and said ""oh Prophet of Allah I will help you"" All the men stood up and laughed. You only have a young boy to support you. His message ignored by most of the people
and his uncles. The prophet continued to meet
his friends secretly in a house near the hill of Safa. The prophet taught them the fundamentals
of Islam and prayed together. They mostly kept to themselves and did not
interact with others in Mecca. But the non believers would try to harass
and abuse them at every opportunity. They continued to suffer in silence and never retaliated. Even the prophet was not spared. One day as he was returning home He met Abu Sufyan Abu Sufyan was the leader of Quraysh. He hated the prophet and his teachings. When he saw the prophet he started to insult him in front
of the others. He also spoke spitefully of Islam. Abu Sufyan went on and checked took a stone and hit the prophet's head
which began to bleed. The prophet suffered this in silence and did not react. He silently went home. A girl silently witnessed the
whole incident. The prophet had an uncle named Hamza. He was a strong and brave warrior who was respected by everyone in Mecca. That day he was returning after
a hunting expedition with his bow hanging by his shoulder. When the little girl met him She told him what had happened
to the prophet. When he heard that his nephew was insulted He was filled with rage. He fled to Caba where Abu Sufyan was
sitting among the people. He struck a violent blow with his bow
on his face. Hamza then shouted You have been abusing Muhammad. I too follow his religion and profess
 what he preached. Hit me back if you can. He shouted. Some people get up to help Abu Sufyan. But he stopped them saying Leave Hamza alone for I have insulted his nephew badly. From that moment on Hamza followed the teachings
of the prophet. In fact, Hamza's conversion derived initially from
the pride of a man who would not accept the notion of others
humiliating his relative But in time He learned the true meaning of Islam. Later He proved to be a source of great strength
to the Islamic faith and its followers. The Quraysh real lies that the prophet
 now has a strong supporter They feared Hamza and stopped persecuting the Muslims
for a while."
"Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam returned to live with his mother in Mecca
when he was about three years old. Three years later, Aminah decided to take her son to visit
his uncle in Yathrib Along with her maid Barak They packed everything they would need
for the long journey. And then they joined one of the caravans
going there. They stayed in Yathrib a month. And the young prophet enjoyed the
visit with his cousin. On their way back to Mecca However, Aminah became ill and died. She was buried in the village
at Al-Abwa not far from Yathrib. The young prophet was now
six year old. And had lost both his father
and mother. He was then adopted by his grandfather
Abd al-Muttalib who loved him dearly and kept him
by his side at all time. It was the custom of Abd al-Muttalib to sit on a blanket near the Kaaba. There he was always surrounded by people
who had come to speak to him. No one was allowed sit on the blanket
with him. However, Except his grandson which shows how close
they were to each other. Many times Abd al-Muttalib
was heard to say this boy will be very important one day. Two years later, Abd al-Muttalib became ill. And the prophet stayed by him constantly. Abd al-Muttalib told his son Abu Talib to adopt the prophet after his death. And he agreed. Abu Talib and his wife were
very happy and proud to receive the young prophet
into their family. Abu Talib had many children
of his own. But the prophet immediately became
part of his family and their favorite child. Abu Talib was a man of great dignity
and commanding presence. During his period as the leader
of Banu Hashim he wore the title of
the lord of Quraysh and chief of the valley. Like other members of his tribe he was also a merchant. and his caravans travel to and
from Syria and Yemen. In every season, Abu Talib's caravans left Mecca for
various destinations. Occasionally He himself accompanied a caravan
to supervise the sale and purchase of merchants dies
in the foreign markets. Such trips often took many months
to complete. When the prophet was twelve years old he accompanied his uncle on
a trade journey to Syria. It was the prophet's first journey
to the north. After days of travel, The caravan arrived at a place
called Bosra where the Romans used to come
to trade with the Arab. A very interesting incident
took place here which caused Abu Talib to return
the prophet to Mecca. Near this market place lived
a monk called Bahira. His sell had been used by generations of
monks before him and contained ancient manuscripts. Bahira had very simple provisions and
 lived a harsh life. Surviving on the bare essentials. His residence was on the main
caravan road. And he regularly saw caravans passing by
carrying different goods destined to be solved in
the great market of Syria. As the prophet's caravan was approaching Bahira was sitting outside his house. He noticed that this caravan was different. There was something special about it. He was amazed when he saw a large white
cloud over the prophet's caravan. It was the only cloud in a clear blue sky. And it appeared to be shading
one of the travelers. The monk was even more surprised
when he saw that. The cloud disappeared when that traveler
sat down under a tree. Bahira knew from the scriptures that
a prophet was expected anytime soon. And it had been his wish to see
the prophet before he died. He realized that what he just seen
was a miracle. And his wish might after all
 might come true. The monks sent an invitation to the Meccans
to come and eat with him. The Arabs were surprised because
 they often passed by and Bahira had never invited them before. When the group was all together
for the meal the monk said Is this everyone? No, Someone said. A boy was left watching the camels. Bahira insisted that the boy
should join them. The boy was Prophet Muhammad
 Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam. When Bahira was the face of Muhammad he was delighted for he was aware from the scriptures of the arrival
of  a mighty prophet. And he could see the signs on
 the young boy. Bahira served the prophet
throughout his meal. He noticed many things about his
appearance which fitted the description in the old manuscripts. Later on he took the young boy aside
and asked him many questions. They talked together about Allah
and about the prophet's life and family. He asked him a series of questions
such as how he sleeps what does he see when he sleeps. What he thinks about and
what he does all day. The young prophet answered truthfully which convinced Bahira of who he is. Then the monk went to Abu Talib and asked
him how he was related to the prophet. Abu Talib told him that the prophet
 was his son. Bahira replied that this could not be so because the boy was destined to
grew up an orphan. Abu Talib confrmed that he was
infact his nephew. what was said made Bahira certain that this was indeed the prophet's
foretold in the scriptures. Bahira revealed to Abu Talib that Muhammad
would be a great prophet one day. He said that when he had seen the caravan
in the distance there was a cloud hanging over them. Which was shading them from the great
heat of the desert. When the caravan had stopped
 under a tree the cloud had also stopped above them. Bahira said that he had seen the stones
and the trees prostrating to Muhammad as he had been walking by. They only do this for a prophet of Allah. This is the master of all humans. Allah will send him with a message
which would be a mercy to all humans. Bahira advised that Muhammad should be
taken back to Mecca at once. As some people would even kill him
if they found out about the boy. Abu Talib took the advice of
the wise old monk ans send the prophet back
with a young man named Abu Bakr Radi Allahu Anhu and Bilal Radi Allahu Anhu It is said that they formed a deep bond
which lasted right through their adult life"
"By the time Prophet Muhammad
 Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam was twenty five he was famous for his honesty. He was respected by everyone even by the elders of Mecca. The purity of his nature increased
 with the earth. It seemed he had an inner knowledge
that other people did not have. The prophet was the finest of his people. The most kind. Truthful and reliable person in Mecca. He was know among Quraysh
 as the trustworthy 'Al-Amin' because of the good qualities
Allah had given him. He spend many quiet hours in a cave in
Mount Hira not far from Mecca thinking about Allah. Thus respected and honored the prophet
lived a quiet life in the family of Abu Talib. He was never coming to us. All through his life he showed no
enthusiasm for the pursuit of riches. If let to himself he would probably have
preferred the quiet life. But he was always anxious to help his uncle who had the burden of a large family
upon him. So whenever the holy prophet
 found an opportunity he cheerfully helped. Among Quraysh lived the best inspiration
in our lives. The woman of wonders the great Khadija Tul Kubra
 Radi Allahu Anha Khadija was born to a father who was
 a successful merchant in their Quraysh tribe of Mecca. She was delicate, intelligent and charm. She inherited her father's skills
 in a time in history where society was male dominated
and dangerous. Upon her father's death She took over the business which was
literally a hard time for her to take this responsibility. And trade goods through the primary
commerce centers of that time from Mecca to Syria and to Yemen. Her business was larger than all of the
Quraysh trades combine. And the most acclaimed with the reputation
of fair dealing and high quality goods. She hired the most trustworthy men of
character  to brave the dangerous trade roads. One day she was looking for someone to
lead her next business trip to Syria. It was during this quest that she learned
about the prophet. On hearing of the prophet's reputation
she was impressed. When Abu Talib heard about the opening he went to her and inquired whether
she would interest this job to his nephew. Khadija who had already heard of
their honesty, trustworthiness and high moral character
of the prophet less no time in accepting his offer and said I would give him twice of what I would give
to the other men of your tribe. When the prophet arrived She asked him to take her goods and trades
with them in Syria. He gladly accepted the offer. And started working for her. She sent her old and trusted slave Maysara
the intelligrated to accompany and serve him. Along the journey they spend the great
deal of time talking together. Maysara soon came to admire the prophet. He thought he was quite different from
all the other men of Quraysh Two unusual events took place during
this journey which puzzled Maysara very much. The first happened when they stopped
 to rest near the lonely home of a monk. The prophet sat under a tree to rest. And Maysara was busy with some work. A monk came to Maysara and asked Who is the man resting under the tree? One of Quraysh the people
who guard the Kaaba. Said Maysara. No one but a prophet is sitting
beneath this tree. Replied the monk. The second event occurred during
the next day. It happened at noon when the sun is at it's hottest. Maysara was riding behind the prophet and as the sun grew hotter He saw a lonely cloud appeared
above the prophet and shield him from the sun's harmful rays. The trading was very successful. And the prophet made
more profit for Khadija than she had ever received before. When they arrived back in Mecca Maysara
told Khadija everything about the trip and what he had noticed about the prophet's
character and behaviour. Khadija was a widow in her fourtees and as well as being rich and
highly respected. She was also very beautiful. Many men wanted to marry her. But none of them suited her. When she met the prophet however she thought he was very special. But how could she express
 her thoughts to him! She already rejected several proposals of
marriage from men belonging to some of the noblest
families of the Quraysh. How would her tribe react! What would her family say! And what was more..would her proposal
would be acceptable to this young yet unmarried man of
the tribe of Quraysh. As she pondered over this questions and debated within herself. One night She dreamed that the shining sun had
descended from the heaven into her courtyard radiating her home. When she woke up she went for
 the interpretation of this wonderful dream to her cousin
Waraqah Ibn Nawfal A blind man noted for his   skills in
interpreting dreams and for his depth of knowledge particularly of the Torah and the Injeel. When he heard her dream he gave a serene smile and told her not to worry as this was a very promising dream. The glorious sun she saw descending
into her courtyard indicated that the prophet whose advent
had been predicted in the Torah and the Injeel was to grace her home. Ad she would gain from his presence
in her life. After this meeting with Waraqah she became
stronger in her desire to marry. She send a friend to ask the prophet
why he was not married. Prophet said that it was because
he had no money. To which the friend replied Supposing a rich beautiful and noble lady
agreed to marry you. The prophet wanted to know who
 that could be. The friend told him it was Khadija. The prophet was very happy. Because he greatly respected Khadija. He went with his uncle Abu Talib
and Hamza to Khadija's uncle and asked his permission to marry her. Soon after the prophet and Khadija were married. Khadija's nobility of character and
conduct pleased Allah so much that he sends special
greetings for her. The prophet lived in her house which became
a blessed place due to his presence."
"""Childhood in Desert"" Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam was born into the most
powerful tribe in Mecca.  the Quraish! For many centuries, it had been customary among the Arabs
to give their newborn children to women from the tribes around the city
to be wet nursed. This was done so that their children would
grew up in the fresh air and the natural environment of the desert. The children could also learn
 the eloquent Arabic dialect whose purest form was to be found at that
time only in the desert. Aminah, his mother and Abd al-Muttalib, his grand father
 and guardian felt it necessary to employ an honorable trustworthy lady to look after the child
of his dear son Abdullah. Halimah al-Sa'adiyah from Banu Saad tribe with a group of ladies arrived
in Mecca that day. Abd al-Muttalib and Aminah offered the
eight year old prophet to Halimah al-Sa'adiyah. Other ladies of the group could get babies
of rich families. But Halimah opted for this orphan as his
father Abdullah had died before his birth. Her companions were apparently happy
with their findings But nobody knew that Halimah was
carrying a baby that was to become arguably ,
the greatest personality in human history! She was starting to notice the multiple
blessings that constantly came their way. Their donkey had always been the slowest
ride because it was frained. And more recently showed signs of
progressive lameness. Bit now it outran the others. Whilst the rest of the party looked
on an amazement. Others wondered if the donkey was the
same one she had come with. The Banu Saad tribe had long been
suffering from famine in the desert. The dry desert and lack of rains had added
much to their poverty and mysery. But from the very day the young prophet
arrived at Halimah's house, good fortune and blessings followed. Her goats started giving
much more milk than before. The pasture around her house turned
 fresh and green. The palm trees bollen abundance of dates. Her life which had been filled with
 poverty and destitution suddenly changed into a happy
and prosperous one. The pale faces of Halimah and her child
became rosy and full of life. Halimah knew that this good fortune
had come because they had the new baby whom they had come to love as if
he were their own son. The Hawazin tribe who lived
in the same village were amused to see this miracle. They couldn't believe their own eyes. The news of Halimah's prosperity
spread fast. People started closely observing
how Halimah fed her animal. They even tried to feed
the camels and sheeps at the exact same place
 where Halimah was feeding. However, Her's always returned full and
yielded abundant milk. But others did not. It was a very happy time for the entire
family and Halimah's foster child grow rapidly in strength and outgrew other
children of similar age. Halimah's tribe in particular was famous
for speaking pure Arabic and on account of their eloquent speech
and poetry. It was in such an environment the young
Muhammed learnt the art of the precise diction of pure Arabic. Halimah never sees to wonder at the
growth and strength of her foster son. Soon it was time for him to go back
to his mother in Mecca. They prepared for the journey. And one day began their travel. When they reached home, Aminah was so delighted to see
and hold her son. But it was the time when an epidemic
had broken out in Mecca. Aminah feared for her son's safety. And it was agreed that Halimah should
take him back with her to their desert home Halimah took the prophet
 back to her home. Several months had passed since
his return from Mecca. One fine day, as usual Halimah took the cattle to graze. Young prophet and Halimah's son
were playing with other children. At the time, the children saw two men dressed in
white working thawb. The men approached to the prophet
and asked him to join them. The kids observed something strange
about these men and they stopped playing. They followed the men. One of the men waved his hands in air
for some time. And suddenly, they saw the Prophet
Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam faint. The children cried and run away in fright. Then using some magic the men opened the young prophet's chest. There was no sign of pain
on the boy's face. The stranger took out
the prophet's heart out. Removed the black portion
 attached to the heart. This black portion was the part which feel people evil. He then threw it away. The other man had a golden bowl which was filled with holy Zamzam water. He then washed prophet's heart
with holy water. The men put the heart back
to his chest. Then again by magic the prophet woke up. And there was no sign of pain
or anything else on his face. The prophet asked him who the stranger was. And the man replied I am Gabriel. I have cleaned your heart with
holy Zamzam water. Right now, All the sins and bad things in your heart
has gone. You are blessed by the grace of Allah! Believe me you are going to be
a messenger of Allah. And you will spread the message of love
and truth to the world. Insha Allah! The angels then walked away. The event of splitting open the chest
and washing the holy heart happened several times throughout
the life of the holy prophet. In this way Allah made his heart pure
for he intend the prophet to be greater than any men ever born! And to become the seal of the prophets. When Halimah finally took the prophet
back to Aminah He was a healthy strong boy. Later he would look back with joy
on the time he had spent with Halimah. And he always thought of himself as
one of the Bani Saad. ""Childhood in Desert"""
"""The first prayer"" The Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam received many revelations during
the course of time. These revelations told the prophet how to
prepare for the time to come. This happened many times repeatedly. And then the revelations seized for a time. The prophet waited for days and weeks. But the angel never came. The prophet was upset and unhappy thinking that Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala
had left him or that he might have angered
Allah in some way. He arrived at the conclusion that Allah
no longer thought him worthy of his message He was sad and disappointed. However The archangel Gabriel came back to him
and consoled him. Then prophet began to speak secretly
of Allah's message  to those who were close to him
and whom he could trust. Mecca was going through hard
and tough times. People were starving. And they were finding it hard to put
food on the table. Abu Talib the prophet's uncle who had taken care
of him after after his grandfather's death was finding it very difficult to feed
his large family. The prophet offered to help him. He would take one of Abu Talib's children
along with him and take care of him. This would reduce the burden
on his uncle. And he readily agreed. The prophet took Ali and another relative took
Abu Talib's second son Jafar. The prophet took care of Ali
and he loved him very much. Ali too adored the prophet
and looked up to him. One day, Gabriel alaihi salaam appeared in front of him with
his most beautiful face and his best smell. The angel kicked the side of a hill and
the spring of water began to flow out. Gabriel alaihi salaam there formed ablution
with that water. He was teaching Prophet Muhammed
how to perform ablution. in order to perform the prayer. Then he told prophet Muhammed to
perform ablution as he did. Then the archangel showed him
all the positions of Muslim prayer. The various movements and things to be
said with each movement . The prophet learned how to pray that day. After wards, The messenger of Allah came to Khadija. And he performed ablution
 in order to teach her. Then Khadija performed ablution
as she had learned from her husband. And then he lead her in the prayer
in the same manner as Gabriel lead him. Since that day, Muslims continued to purify themselves
before prayer by performing the ritual ablution. And have followed the same movements
and prayers first performed by
the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam In the beginning only prophet and his wife
knew how to perform the prayers. One day as they were praying Ali entered the room. Ali was puzzled looking at them. When they finished their prayers, he asked them what they were doing. The prophet explained to him that
they were praising Allah and giving thanks to him. Ali stayed up all night thinking about
what the prophet had said. He had great admiration
and respect for him. When the sun rose next day he went to meet the prophet. He told him that he wanted
to be his follower. Thus Khadija was the first women
to embrace Islam. The teachings which the prophet brought
from Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and Ali was the first young man The prophet witnessed the atrocities
happening all over the region. His country was thrown apart
 by frequent wars. His people sunk in barbarism addicted to barbaric rites
and superstitions. There was no love across the land. His two visits to Syria had opened to him
a scene of a notable moral and social dissolation. Rival crips and sects were fighting
with each other. Their hatred filled the towns of Arabia. The prophet was sad At the beginning of his mission the prophet opened his soul only
to his wife and Ali. He used to often go into the desert
around Mecca with his wife and young cousin that they might together offer
their heartfelt thanks to the lord. One day Abu Talib happened to pass by and he saw them praying. He asked the prophet what they were doing. The prophet told him that they were
praying and following the same religion as Ibrahim alaihis salam. He explained that like
Ibrahim alaihis salam He had been ordered to guide the people
to Allah's truth. The prophet asked his uncle
 if he would join. Abu Talib replied that he can not abandon
the religion of his ancestors. But he promised that no one can hurt the prophet
as long as he lived. Then he turned to his son Ali and told him that the prophet would
never do anything wrong. He asked Ali to go with the prophet."
"'Spreading the Word' The Muslims in Mecca were living in fear. They feared their neighbours they feared their tribes. They didn't know when and where
they would be attacked. The Quraysh were really angry when the
first set of people migrated to Abyssinia. Having the Muslims recognised by their king
humiliated their plans. Islam was now spreading rapidly. They tried their best to spread rumors
about Islam and Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu
Alaihi Wasallam So that people would be discouraged
to join them. Prophet himself was a very kind
and loving person. He treated everyone young and old with kindness and respect. The Quraysh encouraged their people to
harass the prophet at every opportunity. The prophet used to pass by the house
of an old woman. One day as usual he was walking by Suddenly the old woman threw rubbish
on the prophet. The prophet was surprised that he remained silent and didn't show any anger at
the woman's action. The prophet was on his way to the mosque and he walked away without saying anything. The prophet had to pass that house daily
on the way to the mosque. The woman threw rubbish on him whenever
he passed her house. He would pass silently without showing
any anger or annoyance. This was the regular daily event. One day when the prophet was passing by The woman was not there to throw
 the rubbish. He stopped and asked the neighbour
about her well being and wondered why she wasn't dropping
any rubbish on him. The neighbour informed the prophet that
the woman was sick on bed. The prophet politely asked permission
to visit the woman and entered the house. The woman thought that the prophet was
here to take his revenge. But the prophet assured her that he had
come to her not to take any revenge. But to see her and to look after her needs. As it was the command of Allah that
if anyone is sick a Muslim should visit him and should help
him if his help is needed. The old woman was greatly moved
by this kindness and love of the prophet. By the example of greatness
 of the prophet she understood that he was truly
 the prophet of God and Islam was the true religion. She accepted Islam at once. Alhamdulillah! The Quraysh saw the prophet as their enemy and kept asking for a sign. They insisted that unless some sign be send
down to him from his lord they would not believe. The disbelievers used to ask why have you not being send with miracles
like previous prophets. The Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam
replied, because miracles had proved inadequate
 to convince. Noah was send with signs and
with water effect Where was the lost tribe of Thamud They had refused to receive the preaching
of the prophet unless he showed them a sign and cause the rock bring forth
a living camel. He did what they asked. Instead they cut the camel's feet and then
dared the prophet to fulfill his threats of judgment. There are some seventeen places
 in the Quran in which the prophet Muhammad is challenged
to work a sign. And he answered them all to the same
or similar effect. The leaders of Quraysh became
increasingly worried about the way people of Mecca were being
divided by the prophet's teachings. One among them was Umar Ibn Khattab
 Alaihis Salam, one of the nobles of Mecca. He was well known for his physical strength and he was a champion wrestler as well. Everyone in Mecca respected him. Umar Alaihis Salam was getting irritated by what prophet
was doing. And he decided that the only way to
silence the prophet was to kill him. Having made up his mind he set out at once to look for him with a sword in his hand. On his way he met a man who saw at once
what Umar was going to do. And said why don't you look a little closer to home
before going to kill Muhammad Don't you know your own sister
Fathima is a Muslim. Umar was shocked. He could not believe this was true. He vented once to his sister's house. When he arrived outside the house He heard Fathima and her husband Zayd reading aloud Surah Taha a chapter from the Quran. When she heard her brother's voice
 at the door Fathima quickly hid the scroll with the
Surah written on it among the folds of her dress. Umar stormed into the room and demanded What is this nonsense I heard? Fathima and her husband were
afraid to answer. Umar then lost his temper and attacked Fathima's husband shouting. They told me that you have joined Muhammad
in his religion. Fathima tried to defend her husband. And Umar hit her too. Then she admitted Yes.. We are Muslims and we believe in Allah
and his messenger. And you can do what you like. Seeing her faith and courage Umar suddenly felt sorry for what
he had done and said to his sister let me see what I heard you reading
just now. So that I may understand just what it is
that your prophet's preaching. Fathima gave the scroll to him after he had
washed to make himself clean and pure before touching it. And had promised to give it back
 to her after wards. As he read Umar suddenly knew that this
were the most beautiful words he had ever heard. And that this religion must be
the true one. With his sword still in hand he went straight to the prophet's house and knocked loudly at the door. One of the prophet's closest followers
looked out. There stood Umar who was known for 
his courage and strength with a sword in his hand. The follower was afraid for
 the prophet's life. The Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam asked him to allow Umar to come in. The Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam
asked Umar why he had come. To which he replied I have come to swear that there is no God but Allah and that you Muhammad are the messenger of Allah. As soon as he declared his faith he went directly to the Kaaba to perform the ritual encircling 
of the Kaaba known as Tawaf in broad daylight. The people of Mecca were astonished and 
no one dare to say anything. The leaders of Quraysh were even 
more alarmed now. The followers of Islam grow more and more
by the day."
"""The King who Believed"" The Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam had started preaching about Allah
Subhanahu wa ta'ala openly by now. Fearing prophet's uncle Quraysh leaders had stopped persecuting
the Muslims for a while. But soon they were angry again. A group of them went to his uncle Abu Talib
who had promised to protect him. They told him to ask the prophet to stop
attacking their Gods and their way of life. They threatened to harm him
if he did not stop. Abu Talib was very upset by this quarrel
among his people. But he could not break his word
 to his nephew. When he told the prophet about the incident the prophet answered 'Oh my uncle!' 'By Allah, if they put the sun
 in my right hand and the moon in my left in return for  me
 given up this chores, I would not give it up Until Allah makes truth victorious or I die in his service. Abu Talib was deeply moved by his answer. He told him that he would support him for
as long as he lived and encouraged him to go on spreading
Allah's message. From that time on however, hard to leaders of Quraysh tried
to convince Abu Talib to stop protecting his nephew. He always refused to listen to them. In order to get rid of the prophet
and his followers His enemies started persecuting those
Muslims who are poor or weak or had no powerful friends. One such person was Bilal, the slave of
Umayya ibn Khalaf. His master would take him out
into the desert, tie him up and leave him in the sun with a large stone
on his chest. Fortunately Abu Bakr was passing by one day and saw
Umayya torturing Bilal. So he bought him from his master for
a large sum of money and then set him free. But not all persecuted Muslims were
as fortunate as Bilal. Many suffered but all of them in do it patiently  knowing
 that they were doing the right thing. And that they are aware in the life to come
would be greater than any happiness they could find
on earth. As the number of the prophet's
 followers increased So the enemies of the Muslims grow
more and more angry. When the oppression of the Quraysh
became so severe the prophet advised believers to leave
Mecca and migrate to Abyssinia the modern day Ethiopia. Abyssinia, he told them was ruled by a christian king Negus. who did not persecute anyone based
on their believes. The prophet asked believers to stay there
till God shout them an alternative solution to their problem. The Muslims prepared for the journey. They decided to wait until night so that
they could leave without being seen. The first sixteen left Mecca and after
reaching the shore of the dead red sea crossed over to Abyssinia. Another eighty three men and nineteen
women followed. All hoping to be welcomed by the king
and people of that country. This was the first Hijrah or migration in Islam. The Meccans were furious when they
discovered that this Muslims had secretly left the city. Among them were the sons and daughters
of many of the leading families of Mecca. The anger of the Meccans was even greater
when they found out that the Muslims had been warmly welcomed
in Abyssinia. They discussed the matter among themselves
and send two of their men Amr ibn al-'As and Abdullah bin Rabiah to Abyssinia. They were to persuade the King to send
the Muslims back. They met with the King's courtiers
and bribed them. So that they speak in their favor
before the king. After this they entered the court of Negus, the King of Abyssinia. And first presented their gift. Then they requested the King to expel
the immigrants. They claimed that the Muslims invented
a religion that oppose theirs and that of the Negus. The King looked over his advisors who had
already been bribed. They said 'Oh King they speak the truth' 'Their own people know them better and are better acquainted with
what they have done. So that they themselves might judge them.' The King was very angry with this response. He declared he want to surrender
the immigrants to anyone until he himself had a chance
 to question them. After this the King ordered that the Meccan believers
who are living in his land be brought into his court. When this believers were presented
before the King contrary to the local custom they did not prostrate before him. Why do you not kneel before our King? They were asked by one of the advisors. We kneel only to Allah, they replied. The King was no curious. So he asked them to tell him
about the religion. Ja'far ibn Abi Talib a cousin of the prophet stepped forward to speak to Negus with his eloquence and wisdom. Jafar spoke to the Negus saying 'Oh King we were people in a state of ignorance
and immorality worshiping idols and eating the flesh
of dead animal committing all source of abomination
and shameful deeds breaking the ties of kinship treating guests badly and the strong among us exploited the weak' 'We remained in this state until
Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala send us a prophet, one of our own people whose lineage truthfulness, trustworthiness and integrity were well known to us.' 'He called us to worship Allah alone and
to renounce the stone and the idols.' He ordered us to pray to give him arms and to fast.' 'The Meccans began to attack us and come
between us and our religion.' 'So we had to leave our homes and we have
come to you hoping to find justice.' As a christian the King was very much impressed
 by this words. He asked the Muslims to recite something
from their holy book the Quran. Jafar recited the opening verses
of Surah Maryam. A chapter which relates the story of
the birth of both Yahya Alaihis Salam and Jesus Alaihis Salam. As well as a remembrance of how
Maryam Alaihis Salam out of her pity was miraculously
fed with food. Upon hearing the recital the king along with the advisors were moved to tears. The tears rolled down his cheeks wetting his beard. He exclaimed It seems as if these words and those which
were revealed to Jesus are the race of the light which have radiated from the same source turning to the tune and voice from Mecca he said, I am afraid I can not give you back
this refuges. They are free to leave and worship
in my regime. as they please. The gifts which the envoy has
 brought with them were returned and they were sent away. The two Meccans returned home bitterly disappointed. Thus the Muslims lived in Abyssinia
undisturbed for a number of years till they return to Madinah. Eventually the prophet invited Negus to Islam. And in response the king confessed
his faith in Islam and wrote the following reply
 to the prophet. In the name of Allah the most beneficent the most merciful..."
"""The Wise Leader"" For a few years Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam lived  and quiet life as a merchant in Mecca. He was renowned for his wisdom. There were many instances the prophet
helped his people. One such time was when Quraysh decided
to rebuild the Caba. The people were afraid as they had to
knock down the building completely in order to rebuild. They were afraid if Allah Subhanahu
wa ta'ala would punish them for knocking down his sanctuary. They kept asking the others to start
the demolition  work. But in the end the work never started. At last an old wise men of the Quraysh
tribe stepped in. He started removing the stones one by one. And very soon everyone else followed him. They worked very fast and pretty soon
they reached down to the first foundation that Ibrahim Ali Hi Salam had build. And then they started building on top
of the foundation. Each try broke stones and they placed
these on top of another. It was no time to place the black stone. According to popular Islamic legend The stone was given to Adam on
his fall from Paradise and was originally white. But it turned black by absorbing
the sins of the humans. They began to argue about who should have
the honor of carrying the black stone. They couldn't arrive at a decision. Tensions grew and they were getting
angrier by the moment. They almost came to blows. And suddenly one of the wisest old man
stood up and offered a solution. He suggested that they should be guided
 by the first person to enter the place of worship. Everyone agreed. And waited for someone to enter. And soon Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu
Alaihi Wasallam walked in. The prophet was well respected by everyone. And everyone was pleased. They told him about their argument and asked for a solution. The prophet thought for some time and he asked them to bring a large cloth. They did as he asked. And he asked them to spread the cloth
on the ground. Then he told them to place the black stone
in the center. Then he asked the man from each tribe
to hold one edge of the cloth and together to raise it to the height
 where the stone should be seen. When this was done he took the stone of the cloth and put it
into place himself. This story shows how a Quraysh respected
and trusted the prophet and how by his wisdom and good sense he was able to keep the peace. A young boy named Zayd always accompanied the prophet. He was actually presented to Khadija
Radi Allahu Anha as a gift by one of her nephew. This was before the arrival of Islam. And even before her marriage
to the prophet. After a few months or years as per some scholarly opinion Khadija got married to the prophet. And as a gift presented him this young boy
as a slave. The prophet took this young boy and
treated him like family instead of a slave. The two of them never parted ways
since that day. Zayd was the son of Harithah and Suda who were Arabs but not from Mecca. Once while his parents was traveling with
Zayd and his brother They were attacked by an enemy tribe, Zayd was taken as a captive by
the enemy tribe and sold as a slave in the markets of Ukaz. The person who brought him was
Hakim ibn Hizam nephew of the lady Khadija. One day he gifted Zayd to Khadija. And that's how the young boy ended up
in prophet's family. Zayd loved being around the prophet. Meanwhile his father Harithah ever since his abduction was searching for him. Once it all happened that some people from his tribe had come to Mecca for
the annual pilgrimage. And they recognised Zayd. When they reached back home they told Harithah about his son in Mecca. Without losing a second Harithah set to Mecca with his brother. Some say his other son Allahu a'alam Upon his arrival to Mecca they both went to see the prophet. And requested him to set their son free
for a reasonable ransom. The prophet responded by saying that
he would leave the matter to Zayd. If Zayd wanted to go with his father he was free to go without any ransom. However if he wanted to stay with him then his father must allow him to do so. Harithah was pleased at this offer
from the prophet. When Zayd was called and asked whether
he recognised the men before him He replied Yes..he is my father and my uncle. After that He was told about the offer of his leaving
with his father and being set free. To this he responded I would never leave you for anything
in this world. Hearing his son's response Harithah was both surprised
as well as shocked. His son preferred to stay slave and not go as a free man
to his own tribe. It was then that the prophet took Zayd
by hand to Caba. And announced that he had adopted Zayd
as his son. From now on He was to be Zayd Ibn Muhammad. And he would inherit from me and
I would inherit from him. His father was pleased that his son was
 in the household of an honorable family of the Quraysh. He returned home a happy man knowing that
he was now a free man and no longer a slave. Zayd was short and dark skinned. A shy kind of a boy who remained in the
service of the prophet till the end of his life. The prophet treated him like his own son. When the divine revelation came
 to the prophet He was among the first ones to accept it. This beloved of the prophet stood by the
prophet's side through all thick and thin."

The Month of Mercy Ramadan is the month of mercy. Allah (T) gave us the mercy in our hearts. In this month we experience hunger, thirst,
and hardship. And all of these emotions allows our hearts
to be filled with mercy. Allah (T) is the most merciful and he demands
us to show mercy to others. Maybe you remember in our prophet Yusuf (pbuh)
story, how he showed mercy to his brothers. From his childhood, Yusuf (pbuh) was very
special. So his father loved him very much. Because of that his older ten step brothers
were very jealous on him. When Yusuf (pbuh) was eighteen years old,
his ten step brothers decided to kill him. Finally, the brothers decided to throw him
down the bottom of a deep well and left him all alone. On the way they killed a sheep and soaked
Yusuf’s shirt in its blood and told their father that, a wolf came and ate him. The next day a caravan was going to Egypt. On the way, they stop by the well for water
and to their surprise they found Yusuf (pbuh). They took him with them to Egypt and sold
him as a slave. The chief minister of Egypt bought him and
took him into his house but his wife was not good woman. Because of her Yusuf (pbuh) was send to prison. Because of his jealous brothers, one by one
he kept on facing many problems. Yusuf (pbuh) was in prison for more than nine
years but he had his patience in Allah (swt) and prayed to Allah (T). After nine years the king saw a dream. In the dream seven fat cows came out of the
river followed by seven skinny cows. And those seven skinny ones ate the seven
fat ones. Seeing this dream the king was terrified. The king also saw that there were seven grains
which were green and the other seven grains were dry. The king asked every official member to explain
the meaning of the dream but no one could tell the meaning. At that time king knew about Yusuf (pbuh). So Yusuf explained the dream to the king. The king was very happy and released him from
the prison. That’s when a new life started for Prophet
Yusuf (pbuh). The king gave him full control of store houses,
like and he was like the finance minister of Egypt. After seven years, a drought started all over
the middle east. During the drought time Yusuf (pbuh)'s brothers
came to Egypt to buy food. Prophet Yusuf (pbuh) immediately recognized
his step brothers but did not give them any punishment for their evil act. He forgave them and showed mercy to his brothers. Then Allah (swt) became very happy and united
his entire family in Egypt. Like prophet Yusuf (pbuh) we should be Merciful
to everybody in every way. When we talk to each other, we have to be
very good even with our enemy. When Allah (T) sent prophet Musa and Harun
(A) to Pharaoh to accept Allah (T) as a God, he adviced them to speak softly with the Pharaoh. This is the best way to talk and best way
to invite people to Islam. Rudeness is not the solution. Allah (T) loves those who is kind and merciful. Ramadan reminds us to show more mercy to others. There are at least 4 ways to increase mercy
in our hearts. # 1. Stay away from sins. #2. Don't break promises. # 3. Don’t waste your money. # 4. Request Allah (T) to put mercy in our hearts. InshaAllah we will be more merciful and make
Allah (swt) very happy if we do this . For more

"Ramadan  Lessons # 6
Fasting for Stomach When we are fasting, either our stomach is
fasting or our stomach is just starving. Today we will learn how our stomach fast,
inshaAllah. If someone eats haram food and fast, he is
basically starving not fasting. If someone wants to fast they have to eat
halal food. Without halal food there is no fasting. Not only in Ramadan, we should never eat any
Haram food. If you see our 2nd part of our prophet Musa
(pbuh), you will how some of the Bani Israel got a terrible punishment for the Haram food
that they put into their Stomach. According to some of the scholars the location
of that story was in the town of Eilat or Eila, which was next to north side of Aqaba
Golf shore. Allah (swt) chose Friday for their worship
day but the children of Israel chose Saturday for their day of worship. Worship day is known as their holy day. Only for Bani Israel, during their holy day,
they were not allowed to do any kind of work including, hunting or fishing during Sabbath,
which was from Friday’s sunset to Saturday’s sunset. To test the Bani Israel, Allah (swt) used
to send lots and lots of fishes to the shore during Saturdays. The fishes played on the shore openly. But during the other days, fishes did not
come to the shore. So it was very hard to catch fish for Bani
Israel. After some time, one of the Bani Israel figured
out an evil plan to catch those fishes. On Friday, he dug a hole on the shore. He put some tree branches in it and covered
some parts of the hole with a net. What he created was a trap for the fishes. On Saturday, some of the fishs fell into the
trap. And then on Sunday, he collected those fishes
from that trap. Seeing that day-by-day more people started
follow him and used that kind of trap for the fishes. But it was Haram for them to eat that fish,
because technically it was captured on Saturday. When the good people asked them, why were
they breaking Allah (swt)'s Sabbath or Saturday law? The bad people replied to them, they did not
catch those fishes on Saturday. They even argued that they caught those fishes
on Sunday instead. The bad group of people openly broke Allah
(swt)'s law. And because of that, it was Haram for them
to eat those fishes that would go into their stomachs. Prophet Musa (pbuh) warned them about Allah
(swt)'s punishment, but they did not listen. One day, he told the good people to get out
from that town and go outside of the town wall, and close the town gates. The next day, when the good people woke up,
they did not hear any noise from inside the town. They climbed the wall and was surprised to
see the bad people’s condition. Because all of the bad people that stayed
behind in the city had become a monkey with tails. It was a horrible moment for everyone. Some scholars say, that they became monkeys
for three days then everyone died after that. But Allah (swt) knows best. It was a horrible punishment from Allah (swt)
since those bad people filled their stomach with those Haram food. We have to be very careful when we buy food. If we buy our food with Haram money then those
food are also Haram for us and our fasting will not accepted by Allah (swt). Even if we cheat with someone and get their
money or food, then that money or food is Haram for us. If we eat Haram food, that means that our
stomach isn’t fasting, rather our stomach is simply just starving. We must eat Halal food to make sure that our
stomach can fast and then Allah (swt) will accept our fasting InshaAllah. For more information we can see  the Surah:
al-Mu'minin: 51 al-Baqarah: 172
al-A`raf: 157 Al `Imran: 130

"Wasting During Ramadan
Allah (T) does not love those who are wasteful. But unfortunately we do lot of wasting during
Ramadan. In Ramadan we waste our time, money, food
and energy in many ways. Sometimes in Ramadan we cook so much food,
yet we can’t even finish all those food. So, that means that every day we have to throw
away our extra food. But we should think about how in some countries
a lot of people are fasting without eating Suhor or Iftar. So we should give donation to them instead
of wasting our food. In prophet Isa (pbuh)'s story, we can see,
that during the spring time Bani Israel had a very big special holiday that they celebrated,
around the month of April, which is called 'Passover'. It was a celebration of gratefulness to Allah
(swt), for saving the Bani Israel from slavery in Egypt hundreds of years ago during prophet
Musa (pbuh). Usually it was an eight day celebration where
there would be lots of people who used to come from different places to the Baitul Maqdis
in Jerusalem. Prophet Isa (pbuh) thought, that would be
the perfect time to go to the Baitul Maqdis and guide the people about Allah (swt)’s
laws. According to the historians, Prophet Isa (pbuh)
entered Jerusalem on Saturday, which was the first day of the 'Passover' holy day week. He went to the temple area and looked around. He noticed that there were so many priests
and they made money from the temple for their own high living expenses. The rooms inside the temple were filled with
the priests and their people but were only very few visitors who were allowed to come
inside those room, because it was very expensive for the common people. Every single place inside the temple, the
visitors would have to spend money. Suppose a poor family wanted to sacrifice
a sheep for Allah (swt). After that family raised their sheep, when
they go to the temple with that sheep to sacrifice, the priests did not allow them to sacrifice
their own sheep because they would want the people to buy sheep from the temple people. Because of that only the rich people were
welcome inside the temple. The Priests and their people acted as if the
temple was a market place. And it was so bad that inside the temple the
priest used to waste lots of food even though they knew that just right outside of the temple
there were poor people who were very hungry. Prophet Isa (pbuh) became very sad after seeing
that situation, because he knew Allah (swt) hates those who do any type of wasting. Sometimes during Ramadan we stay in the bed
for a long time and don't do anything. Sometimes we do that so that we won't feel
hungry or thirsty throughout the day. However, when we do this we become very lazy
and we waste our valuable time. In fact, we should use our valuable Ramadan
time properly by reading the Quran, Hadith or any Islamic books. During this month sometimes we even waste
our money. For Eid some of us want to buy more than one
outfit or we just buy very expensive clothes or shoes. We might sometimes even compare with our friend,
that if someone have 2 new set of dresses, we want to buy 3 or more new set of dresses. Sometimes we are very cheap when it comes
to charity or donation, yet we are wasting soo much money for Eid preparation! Ramadan is a very special month for us. This month comes only once a year. So we should be a good Muslims and try not
to waste our time, money or food. For more information we can see Surah:
Al-An'am, verse 141 Al-Isra, verse 26 &amp; 27
Al-Insan, verse 8,9 &amp; 10 Al-Anfal, verse 31"
"Ramadan  Lessons # 19
Zakat-ul-Fitr Another name for Zakat-ul-Fitr, is Sadaqat
ul-Fitr which is a type of charity or donation. The word Fitr means the same thing as Iftar,
which is the breaking of our fast. So Zakat-ul-Fitr is a type donation which
is only given to the poor people during the end of Ramadan. Zakat-ul-Fitr is a very small amount of donation,
so almost, all Muslims have to pay this to the poor people. Even for little children, their parents have
to pay Zakat Ul Fitr for them. When we all do this, it helps Muslims come
closer to each other. The rich come to the poor people, poor people
come to the extremely poor people. By giving this donation, this is a very good
training for those who are very cheap, although that’s not the main reason for Zakat-ul-Fitr. During the month of Ramadan we try very hard
to fast in the most perfect way but we  are all human, we make mistakes and Allah
(T) knows that. So Allah gives us an opportunity to finish
our fasting perfectly by giving Zakat-ul-Fitr to the poor. It is like water for our fasting. When we are fasting we might make an unknown
mistake, but Zakatul fitr will clean that mistake like water, Inshallah. Sometimes we are confused between Zakat and
Zakatul Fitr. There are 4 main differences between Zakat
and Zakatul Fitr. No. 1: For Zakat: Those who have a certain
level of savings or wealth only they have to pay Zakat. For Zakatul Fitr: every Muslim, rich or poor,
man or women, adult or baby have to pay Zakatul Fitr. No. 2: Zakat purifies our money or wealth. But Zakatul Fitr purifies our fasting that
we do in Ramadan. No. 3: we can spend our Zakat money in eight
categories or sections. But we can give our Zakatul Fitr only to the
very poor people. No. 4: Zakat can be given at any time of the
year but Zakatul Fitr has a very limited timeframe. According to Abbas(R), the best time to pay
our Zakatul Fitr is on the morning of  Eid Day before Eid prayer. For more information we can see Hadith from:

12 Mistakes We Make in Ramadan Ramadan is the most special month of the whole
year. In this month, Allah (swt) is waiting to forgive
us and wants to reward us unlimitedly. But unfortunately we are not using this blessing
month in a smart way. Sometimes we are wasting this very important
time of this month. There are actually around 12 ways we can waste
our most important time in this month. And these 12 mistakes are the most common
mistakes that we make all the time because we sometimes forget how we can increase our
good deeds in this month of Ramadan. # 1. Our 1st mistake is wasting our time by sleeping
the whole day during Ramadan. Instead of sleeping we could do many good
jobs and get many, many rewards from Allah (swt). # 2. Even if we are not sleeping the whole day,
we sometimes spend our time being lazy, and not doing any good jobs. Instead of being lazy we should memorize some
Du'as from the Quran or read the Quran with meaning. # 3. Many time we waste a lots of time by playing
games or watching TV during the day. But what we could is spend our time by watching
Islamic program and gain more knowledge about Islam. # 4. Sometimes we might not realize it but we might
be fasting in a foolish way. If we are trying to show other people that
we are fasting, we aren’t fasting for Allah (swt). Also when we are fasting, if we drink or eat
something secretly, we might think that no one will know, but don’t forget Allah (swt)
always knows. So just remember, that we should not be showing
off to others when we are fasting or else it will not be accepted by Allah (swt). # 5. Cooking takes a lot of time and especially
in this month; sometimes we spend too much time in the kitchen to prepare our food. We should not cook too much food or several
food items. If we do it will waste our very important
time of Ramadan. # 6. Especially with classes going on during the
month of Ramadan, we might be staying awake the whole night doing homework or doing nothing. In this month, night time prayers are very
important. Specially praying Taraweeh or extra prayer
as much as possible will be beneficial just for us. # 7. Sometimes even after praying Taraweeh quickly,
we start to spending our time with friends or family by just talking. We totally forget that Allah (swt) loves night
time prayers and there are lots of rewards for that. We should spend our night time very wisely,
so that we can get lots of rewards from Allah (swt). # 8. After a whole day of fasting we love to eat. But sometimes we eat so much that we start
to feel very tired. So because of that sometimes we can't pray
our night time prayer properly. Because of this, sometimes we miss our most
important prayer Taraweeh. # 9. Sometimes during Ramadan, we see movies, listen
to songs, or just enjoy the night rather than worshipping Allah (swt). We need to remember that time goes by very
fast. If we miss one night of blessings, we have
missed that night of blessing for whole life, which we will never get after. # 10. The month of Ramadan is very important in
general but the last 10 days of the month are the most important. During the last 10 days, one of the most important
is, 'Qadar night'. But sometimes we can see that we are wasting
those last 10 days to prepare for Eid. Rather than worshipping Allah (T). # 11 . We need to keep our house clean all
the time. But again during the last few days, sometimes
we are so busy cleaning the whole house much more than needed to prepare for Eid! And we forget that we are losing the most
important time of the month. # 12. Eid shopping. When we are shopping in Ramadan we are wasting
our most important time of the month. We can easily solve that problem by doing
the shopping before Ramadan and spend more time for Allah (swt) in this holy and most
blessed month of Ramadan. Every moment of Ramadan is a blessing moment. If we miss these moments, we are the losers. We all have to be careful on how we are spending
our time. From now on, we have to try our best to utilize
our time, so that we can spend our time to worship Allah (T). For more information we can read surah:
An-Nahl 43 Al-'A`raf 31

Love &amp; Brotherhood In Islam  love and brotherhood with each other is very
important. All Muslims should be united together as one. So that means that our hearts should be connected
with one another so that we can stay together as one. (pray scene). In Islam we are all brothers and sisters,
which is why we should love each other, as well as look out and care for each other. And doing so that is the only way we can stay
united at all times. If any Muslim is hungry, it is our job to
give them food. If there is any Muslim who doesn’t have
a place to live, then we should give them a place to live. If there is any Muslim brother or sister who
is facing any problems, then it is our job to help them and pray for them. If you see 2nd part of our prophet Musa (pbuh)
story, you will see how prophet Musa and Harun (pbut) showed their love and brotherhood to
the Bani Israel. When the Bani Israel forgot Allah (swt) and
made a golden cow as their god, Musa (pbuh) was very angry and broke and burned the golden
cow into pieces, which afterwards, he then threw them into the river. Worshiping any idol is a horrible crime. So to get pardon from Allah (swt) for their
crime, he chose 70 leaders from Bani Israel and took them to Mount Sinai. Those leaders requested Prophet Musa (pbuh)
to hear Allah (swt)'s voice. Allah accepted their request. Then a big cloud came and covered them. And when Allah (swt) talked prophet Musa (pbuh),
they heard Allah (swt)'s voice. When the clouds were gone some of the leaders
demanded to see Allah (swt). They said that if they did not see Allah (swt)
they would not believe in him. Their arrogant demand made Allah (swt) very
angry. Suddenly a thunder came and the electricity
from that thunder killed them instantly. Prophet Musa (pbuh) was helpless. He did not know what to do. His love for the brotherhood of Bani Israel,
he requested Allah (swt) not to kill them because they were good people among Bani Israel. Allah (swt) accepted his request. So all of the 70 leaders got their life back. After being brought back to life, they all
asked forgiveness from Allah (swt) for their sins. Because they were very ungrateful, Allah (swt)
revealed a very hard law for the Bani Israel. Prophet Musa came to his people and told them
to kill each other. To get Allah (swt)'s pardon everyone had to
follow his order. That was a horrible moment for Bani Israel. So, they started to kill their own people. When prophet Musa and Harun (pbut) saw that
horrible moment, their love for their brotherhood rose for the bad poeple and they started to
request Allah (swt) to forgive the Bani Israel; otherwise, the nation of Bani Israel would
be destroyed. Allah (swt) accepted their prayer. To stop the killing, suddenly everything became
dark. Prophet Musa (pbuh) announced good news to
his people, that Allah (swt)'s had forgiven everyone’s sins. Same as prophet Musa and Harun (pbut) we always
should pray for each other and help each other with by loving our brothers and sisters.. In the house of Islam we have brothers and
sisters. We have to feel like we are all connected
as one. In Ramadan we have the best chance to make
our brotherhood stronger. InshaAllah Allah will help us. For more information we can see surah: Al-'Anfal:63

"Month of Asking Forgiveness
In the month of Ramadan we should feel sorry for our past bad deeds and actions and then
ask forgiveness from Allah (T) and promise not to do that kind of bad deed again. In this blessing month Allah (swt) is waiting
to forgive us. But we are lazy to request Allah (swt) to
forgive us. One thing we need to keep in mind that is
that, no matter what, Allah love us and if we make a mistake, he also loves to forgive
us. The only thing we need to do is to ask Allah
(swt) so that he can forgive us. From the Hadith books of Sahih Bukhari and
Sahih Muslim, in one story we will see how merciful Allah (swt) is and how even a very
bad man can get Allah (swt)'s forgiveness. Long, ago there was a man who killed 99 people. After awhile, he felt sorry for his act and
he wanted to ask forgiveness from his creator, Allah (T). He asked a religious leader, whether it was
possible for him to get Allah’s forgiveness. The religious leader said, no. That man became very upset and killed that
religious leader too and completed killing 100 people. But even then he really wanted to ask forgiveness
from his Lord Allah (T). So he went another wise religious scholar
and asked whether it was possible for him to repent. The scholar said, yes and told him to leave
this evil land and move to the land where people worshipped Allah (T). So that man left, and when he reached the
halfway point of his journey, he died. The angels of Mercy and the angels of Punishment
discussed with one another, what to do. Then an angel came in the form of a human
being, and both the angels asked him to solve the problem. So he said, ‘Measure the distance between
the two lands. If he closer to the evil land, angels of Punishment
will take him but if he is closer to the good land, the angels of Mercy will take his soul
instead. Then they measured the distance and with Allah
(T)’s blessing, they found that, he was closer to the good land, so angel of Mercy
took his soul. Allah (T) is very merciful because he is our
creator and without him there is nobody else who can forgive us. In this month, if we aren’t sorry for our
bad jobs and don't ask forgiveness from Allah (swt), we will have very bad luck. In this month, Allah (swt) is waiting for
us to ask forgiveness from him. So it doesn’t matter how big our sins are,
as long as we trying to fix our mistake and ask forgiveness from Allah (swt) that is the
main part. For more information  we  can see Surah:
Az-Zumar, verse 53 Ali 'Imran, verse 135
Ash-Shuraa, verse 25 An-Nahl, verse 92
Sahih Al-Bukhari Sahih Muslim"
"Month of Dawah
Giving Islamic Dawah to other people is very important, especially during the month of
Ramadan. Dawah means, inviting people to Islam and
encouraging people to follow Allah (swt)'s law. This is the best job in this entire world
and that’s exactly the job that all of the prophets did. In Islam giving dawah is mandatory to all
Muslims. In Surah Nahl verse 125 Allah (swt) ordered
us to invite the people to Islam in very good way. If you see our prophet Yunus (pbuh) story,
you will see what happened when prophet Yunus (pbuh) did not do his Dawah work properly. Allah (swt) sent prophet Yunus, or in English
known as Jonah (pbuh), to the big town of Nineveh. They were very bad who used to worship the
idols and did not believe in Allah (swt). The people did not like prophet advice. They even argued that they were not afraid
of Allah (swt). Prophet Yunus (pbuh) became very sad and angry
at them. He lost his hope on those people. He thought Allah (swt)'s punishment would
come to those people in any time. So without Allah (swt)'s permission, he left
his people and abandoned his town of Nineveh, which was where Allah (swt) appointed him
to give Dawah to the people. He hardly left the city when the skies began
to change color and looked as if they were on fire. When the people saw that they started to fear
the punishment was coming from Allah (swt) to destroy them all. Immediately they believed in Allah (swt). Everybody in that town, adults and children
gathered in the mountains and started to cry to get mercy and forgiveness from their creator
Allah (swt). Allah (swt) accepted their request and forgave
them. When Allah (swt) removed the storm from them,
they prayed for the return of prophet Yunus (pbuh) to guide them. But prophet Yunus (pbuh) was far away from
the town at that point since he got in a small passenger ship to cross the sea. It sailed all day in calm waters with a good
wind blowing at the sails. When night came, the sea suddenly changed. A horrible storm blew as if it were going
to break the ship into pieces. The waves were very big and wild. They rose up as high as the mountains. In the mean time Allah (swt) sent one of the
biggest whales in the ocean, who was the right behind the ship and kept his mouth open as
he obeyed Allah (swt) to follow the ship. They did not know what to do. The chief crewman asked the others to lighten
the ship's heavy load, so they threw their baggage into the water but that was not enough
for their safety. At that time the non believers thought the
sea and the wind were some of their gods. So they decided to please their angry gods
by throwing the people one by one into the sea but that was very hard task for them to
choose who they will throw out into the water first. So they drew a lottery among themselves. Prophet Yunus (pbuh) name appeared three times. Prophet Yunus (pbuh) realized that Allah (swt)'s
hand was in all this because he did not take permission from Allah (swt) to leave the Dawah
work for his people. When he realized the storm was because of
him, he stood at the edge of the ship and threw himself into the sea by the name of
Allah (swt). Immediately, he disappeared in a huge wave
and the whale which was waiting for him swallowed him into his stomach. Inside the stomach he was scared of Allah
(swt). He was very sorry for his mistake since he
did not do his Dawah work properly. He prostrated to Allah (swt) in the belly
of the whale and recited the very powerful dua for his pardon. And finally Allah (swt) forgave him and sent
him back to his people to continue his Dawah work. The same way we should always think to give
Islamic Dawah to the people, so they can follow Allah (swt)'s order. In Dawah work we have to be very sincere and
truthful. To give dawah we also need a really good knowledge
about Islam. In Dawah work we have to be very gentle and
we can't be rude. Even, when Allah(T) sent prophet Moses and
Aaron (pbut) to the Pharaoh, Allah (T) advised them to be gentle with the Pharaoh. For Dawah work we have to have to use good
manners and keep our patience. For the Dawah work we have to follow this
rule. Suppose when our prophet Muhammad (s) sent
some Sahabas to Yemen, he advised them, first give dawah about the one and only God and
accept Mohammad (s) as a prophet. If they accepted this then advise them to
pray five times a day. In Ramadan every Muslim has to give Dawah
to the people and get lots of reward from Allah (swt). For more informaiton we can see Surah: Surah
al-Bayyinah: 5 Surah Al-Baqarah: 44
Surah 'Ali-Imran: 159 Sahih Bhukhari

"Ramadan Lessons # 20
I'tikaaf I'tikaaf means staying at the mosque to worship
Allah (T) for the last ten days of Ramadan. Within our daily activities our heart becomes
weak for Allah (T), however I'tikaaf can help our heart to be clean and strong for Allah
(T). In one hadith, our prophet Mohammad (S) said,
in the body we have an organ, if it is good we are good, and if it is bad we are bad. That organ is our heart. So, to keep our heart good, we can stay in
the mosque the whole time during the last ten days of Ramadan. If you can do that , Allah will give us lots
of rewards. When do I'tikaaf, it means that we will have
a better chance and so that we won't miss the Qadr night, which the night that’s better
than 1000 months. Overall, I'tikaaf will help us to be a better
Muslim. For an example let’s think back to prophet
Isa (pbuh)'s mother, Mariyam (pbuh) story. Her father’s name was Imran (pbuh). He was a very good religious leader for the
children of Israel, but he was not a prophet. Imran and his wife (pbut) did not have any
child for many years but they did not lose her faith. With Allah (swt)'s blessing during their old
age Imran's wife became pregnant. She was so happy that she promised to give
her child for Allah (swt)'s work. During her pregnancy her husband Imran (pbuh)
died. After a few days she gave birth a baby girl,
Maryam (pbuh). When she was old enough to work in the temple,
her mother gave her to the temple. At that time women were not allowed to stay
inside the temple. So, she needed a guardian at the temple. For her protection, her uncle, Zakaria (pbuh)
built a separate room inside the temple. As she grew up, she became a very religious
woman. When Mariyam (pbuh) became a teenager she
needed a private quiet area for her I'tikaaf. So she started to live on the east side of
the Temple, which was a very quiet place. Prophet Zakaria (pbuh) used to visit her daily
and taught her about Allah (swt)'s laws. Allah (swt) was very happy for her I'tikaaf. So, Allah (swt) sometimes used to send fruits
to her. One day during her I'tikaaf, Allah (swt) sent
a very good news to Mariyam (pbuh) by an angel. The Angel told her, with Allah (swt)'s plan
she would give birth to a very good son and he would be prophet Isa or Jesus (pbuh). Because she used to do I'tikaaf for Allah
(swt), in history, Allah (swt) made her one of the top 4 greatest women of all time. The same way, to get a special gift from Allah
(swt) we need to spend the last ten days of Ramadan in the mosque. We can do I'tikaaf at any time of the year. But the last ten days of Ramadan is extremely
special. Our prophet Mohammad (S) never missed these
ten days of I'tikaaf. Whoever does the I'tikaaf during this time,
Allah (T) will give them countless of rewards. During I'tikaaf we can't do anything except
pleasing Allah (T). You can pray, read the Quran, Hadith , or
Islamic books. When we are hungry we can eat and when we
are sleepy we can sleep. If we start our I'tikaaf InshaAllah our Imam
can guide us on how to do I'tikaaf. The only thing we have to decide is to do
I'tikaaf, and the rest Allah will make it very easy, inshallah. For more information we can see from Hadith:
Bhukhari Muslim
Ibn Majah an-Nasa`i
Tirmidhee Abu Dawood"
"Taraweeh
During the month of Ramadan, sometimes all we focus on is our fast throughout the day. But we also need to remember that Taraweeh
is a big portion of our ibadah or worship. Another word for taraweeh is Qiyamul lail
meaning prayer of the night. The meaning of Taraweeh is rest and relax. That’s because when we perform this extra
prayer, after Isha, every 4 rakat, we have to take some rest before continuing on. Our prophet Mohammad (s) said that if someone
prays Taraweeh prayer with their faith and dedication, Allah (T) will forgive all of
their past sins. Another thing that we should know is that
Allah made Ramadan fard, but when it comes to Taraweeh, Allah (swt) made that sunnah. There is actually an interesting history behind
why Taraweeh was sunnah and not fard. One Ramadan night the prophet Muhammad (s)
prayed Taraweeh with few Sahabahs in order to increase their ibadah. And then the next day, when prophet Muhammad
(s) was praying Taraweeh, more people joined the prophet. On the 3rd day there were more and more people
joined in for Taraweeh. Then on the 4th day, the prophet realized
that even more people came compared to before. Seeing that, he was afraid that if he came
on the 4th day, Allah (swt) might make Taraweh fard for Muslims. The prophet Muhammad (s) didn’t want Allah
(swt), to make Taraweeh fard for us because, praying those prayers might be hard for some
people. So on the 4th day, since the prophet did not
come, the Sahabas prayed Taraweeh by themselves. Years later, when our prophet Muhammad (s)
passed away, there were no more possibilities that Allah (swt) would make Taraweeh fard. So one Ramadan night, Umar (R) saw that in
the mosque, everyone was praying Taraweeh all by themselves or in small groups. Seeing that, he offered Ubaid bin Kabb to
be an imam and told everyone to pray Taraweeh with him. So after that, Sahabas started praying Taraweeh
with a big gathering. Even though Taraweeh is sunnah, but there
are lots of reward from this prayer. So we should not to miss out this big opportunity
to get the huge reward in this blessing month. Sometimes you might be really tired to pray
Taraweeh, but when we think about how much rewards, we can get from Allah(swt) then InshaAllah,
we won’t feel lazy or tired to pray. For Taraweeh, some people pray 8 rakats, while
others pray 20 rakats. All we need to know is at least 8 rakats Taraweeh
prayers are the sunnah of our Prophet Muhamamd (s). However, if we are able to pray 20 rakats,
then we should because that means that we will get even more rewards. If we want more information about taraweeh,
we can  look up the Hadith from:

"Asalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! What were you reading my son? I was reading a book
on Prophet Yunus (as). Is it true that the Prophet
was swallowed by a huge whale? Yes, its true my son! And did the Prophet
live after that? Yes he did. Do you want to hear
his story today? Yes, I do!
Please tell me Baba Alright.. Now listen carefully Bismillah! The Story of Prophet Yunus (as) A long long time ago, there was a city named Nineveh. The people of Nineveh
were idolaters, who lived a shameless life. Prophet Yunus (as) was
sent by Allah(swt) to Nineveh, to preach to them
about the true God. “You should believe only in
Allah(swt) and obey his commands” He told them “Otherwise a severe punishment
will come upon you” He warned them But the inhabitants of the town didn’t like anyone to interfere
 in their way of worship. “We and our forefathers have worshipped
 these Gods for many years” said an old man “And no harm has come
to us” added another Prophet Yunus (as) tried very hard to
convince the people about Allah (swt). But the people kept ignoring him He warned that if they kept
on with their foolishness, Allah(swt) will soon punish them Instead of fearing Allah(swt), they told the Prophet that they
were not afraid of his threats. “Let your God punish
us” they told him The Prophet was
disheartened by now. “In that case I will leave
you to your misery” saying that, he left
the town of Nineveh. The Prophet became
impatient and he departed without waiting for further
commands from Allah(swt). He knew that God must
be angry on him, so he decided to travel
to a distant land. As soon as the Prophet
left the city, the skies began to
change its color. It looked like
they were on fire! The people were filled
by fear at this sight! They remembered the destruction of
the people of ‘Ad, Thamud and Nuh! Slowly faith started
penetrating their hearts. The people of Nineveh gathered
on the top of a mountain, and started to pray to
Allah(swt) for His mercy. The mountains echoed
with their cries, the people of Nineveh repented
sincerely for the sins they had committed. When Allah(swt) heard
their prayers, he decided not to punish them, and He showered His blessing
upon the people once again! When the people realized
that they were saved, they prayed to Allah(swt) for
the return of Yunus (as), so that he could guide them Meanwhile, Yunus (as) had boarded a small
ship in the company of other passengers. It sailed all day in calm waters, with a
good wind blowing at the sails. But as the night came, the sea suddenly changed. There was a horrible storm, and it looked like the ship was
going to be split into pieces! The waves rose as
high as mountains, tossing the ship up and down! Everyone in the ship
were terrified! The captain of the ship
shouted to the crew to lighten the ships heavy load. The crew first threw
their baggage overboard, but this was not enough! Their safety lay in reducing
the weight further, so they decided among themselves,
that one among them  will have to be thrown into the sea. In the meantime, a large whale had
surfaced behind the ship. Allah (swt) had commanded
the whale to surface, and it had obeyed. The whale kept following the
ship as he had been commanded. And back at the ship, the captain told them “We will make lots with
all the travelers names. The one whose name is drawn
will be thrown into the sea. Yunus (as) reluctantly
participated in the lot, and his name was added as well. When the lot was drawn, the paper had “Yunus”
written on it! Since the crew knew that the Prophet
was the most honorable man among them, they didn’t want to
throw him into the sea. Therefore they decided
to draw a second lot. And when they drew the
lot for the second time, the name of the Prophet
appeared again!! The crew decided to give one
final chance to the Prophet, and drew a third lot. But the Prophet’s name appeared during
the third and final lot as well! The Prophet realized that Allah(swt) was
involved in what was going on. He realized that Allah(swt)
was punishing him, because he had abandoned the
mission without Allah (swt)'s consent. It was decided that the Prophet
should throw himself into the water. Yunus (as) stood at
the edge of the ship, looking at the furious sea. It was night and there
was no moon in the sky. The stars were hidden
behind a black fog. Before jumping into the sea, the
Prophet kept mentioning Allah(swt)’s name. He then jumped into the sea, and disappeared beneath
the huge waves. The whale that was following the ship, found the Prophet floating
on the waves. It didn’t waste anytime, and swallowed the
Prophet in one gulp! The whale shut its ivory teeth, as if they were white bolts
locking the door of his prison. It then dived to the
bottom of the sea. The Prophet imagined
himself to be dead, but his senses became alert when he figured that
he was able to move. He realized that he was alive, and knew that he was imprisoned. In his loneliness, he started to think
over what had happened in the town, and realized that he should
have never left the town. Instead, he should have stayed and
kept on speaking to the people, asking them to return to Allah(swt) In his despair, the Prophet started to
pray with all his heart to Allah(swt). “O Allah, there is no
God apart from You. You alone do I praise and honor. I have done wrong, if You do not help me, I shall be lost for ever” The Prophet continued praying
 to Allah(swt), repeating his prayers. Fishes, whales and many other creatures
that lived in the sea, heard the voice  of the Prophet's prayers,
coming from the whale's stomach All these creatures gathered
around the whale, and began to praise Allah(swt), each in its own language!! The whale also participated
in praising Allah(swt). Then he understood that he
had swallowed a Prophet! When he realized this, He felt afraid at first! He then said to himself
“Why should I be afraid? Allah(swt) commanded me
to swallow him” Allah(swt) Almighty saw the sincere
repentance of the Prophet, and He decided to save him! He commanded the whale
to go the surface, and eject the Prophet
onto the shore. The whale obeyed and swam to
the surface of the ocean. He then ejected the Prophet
onto a remote island! The Prophet was very sick
now because of the acids inside the whale’s stomach. His skin was inflamed, and when the sun rose, the rays burned his body! The Prophet was on the verge of screaming
 with pain by now.  But he endured the pain and continued
 his prayers to Allah (swt) Allah(swt) then caused
a tree to grow behind where the Prophet was praying. This tree protected the Prophet from the
 harsh rays of the sun,  and it gave him nourishing fruits as well! Gradually, he
regained his strength and found his way
back to Nineveh. He was pleasantly surprised to
notice the change that took place! The entire population of Nineveh turned out to welcome him!! They informed him that they 
now worshipped Allah(swt), the one true God. The Prophet was very
happy to hear that, and he lived happily in
Nineveh until he died! Masha Allah! That was such a wonderful story! I’m glad you liked it my son. Now are you ready
for the questions? Yes I am! Alright, now tell me the name of the town where
Prophet Yunus (as) preached It was Nineveh! That was quick! Now for the next question. Why did the Prophet
leave the town? The Prophet was angry at the people of
Nineveh for not listening to his words. That’s why he left the town, even before God told him to. Mashallah! 
That’s excellent my son. Now tell me why did the
Prophet jump into the sea? The ship that the Prophet was travelling
 got caught in a storm.  The captain and the crew decided that they
 will  have to throw one person from among them, so as to
 lighten the load. The Prophet had to
jump into the sea because his name came up
while drawing the lots. Excellent Amir. Now for the last question. How did the Prophet escape
from the whale’s stomach? The Prophet kept praying to God
while he was in the whale’s belly God saw the sincere
repentance of the Prophet, and He decided to save him! God then commanded the
whale to go the surface, and eject the Prophet
onto the shore. Masha Allah! You give all
the right answers today! I will tell you another
story tomorrow, Good night my son! Good night Baba!"
"(----No dialogue----) Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! What do you want
to do today Amir? Today is Sunday Baba, Will you take me to the Garden? Of course my son, Get ready and eat
your breakfast. We will go to the
garden after that! That’s great! Let me get ready then! Are you ready? Yes, come on lets go! (----No dialogue----) Come Amir,
let’s sit on that bench (----No dialogue----) It’s a beautiful day, isn’t it? Yes, it is! Thank you for bringing me here! Hey, look at that father and son! Don’t they look cute? Father and son? That old man must
be his grandfather! He is too old to be his father! No Amir, I know him. His name is Basheer, he works with me. And that is his son Nizam. (----No dialogue---) But he is too old to
have such a young son! How could that be? (----No dialogue---) Now you are forgetting the 
powers of Allah, my son! He can work miracles, you know that! I.. I’m sorry Baba! Wait! I just remember the story
of this Prophet who had a son,  when he was Ninety years old! (----No dialogue---) Please tell me his story Baba! Alright, now listen carefully Bismillah! (----No dialogue---) The story of Zakariya (as) (----No dialogue---) Zakariyah (as) was an illustrious
Prophet of the Israelites. He was one of the descendants
of Sulaiman (as). He worked as a carpenter, and he led a simple life
like most of the other Prophets. (----No dialogue---) He had a wife and her 
name was al-Yashbi,  who belonged to the family of
 Prophet Harun (as) (----No dialogue---) The Qur’an does not provide accounts
of the Prophet’s childhood or youth. Hence the story of this Prophet
begins when he was Ninety years old! (----No dialogue---) Zakariyah (as) was a faithful
 follower  of Allah (swt), and he was very humble
 in his behaviour. Like his ancestor Ibrahim (as),  the Prophet too reached an old age
without having any children. (----No dialogue---) It was during this time, that the wife of Imran (as), or his
sister in law gave birth to Maryam (as) (----No dialogue---) But shortly after,
 Imran (as) passed away. And this sparked off a dispute within
Bani Israel regarding her guardianship. (----No dialogue---) Zakariyah (as) should have
been the ideal choice, for he was her Uncle, and a Prophet whose moral
character was beyond question. But Bani Israel
disputed this choice, for everyone wanted the prestige of
raising the daughter of Imran (as) (----No dialogue---) The people finally agreed to cast
lots to decide on the matter. Zakariyah (as) kept silent, and
remained in his good behaviour. (----No dialogue---) The people who wanted to
become the guardian wrote their names on wooden pens,
 and put them in a container. (----No dialogue---) Then a child was asked to
pick one pen from the box. (----No dialogue---) The pen that the child selected
bore the name of Zakariyah (as)! (----No dialogue---) But the people were not happy! Many of them asked for the
cast to be repeated!! (----No dialogue---) The Prophet kept
silent, and agreed. (----No dialogue---) This time the claimants all put
their pens into the river. It was decided that the pen 
that would flow against the current would win the guardianship
 of Mariyam (as) (----No dialogue---) It was a miracle! All the pens of the claimants 
floated along with the river’s current, but the Prophet’s did not! It floated against the current!! (----No dialogue---) But the people weren’t
happy with this either! They were not convinced, and
they demanded a third round!! (----No dialogue---) This time, they demanded that 
the pen that floated with the current would
 win the cast (----No dialogue---) They threw their pen into the river,
and again the Prophet won the cast!! The Prophet’s pen floated with the current, while others pen drifted upstream!! (----No dialogue---) Such is the power of Allah(swt)! The people may plot and plan, but
what is written will take place (----No dialogue---) Thus Bani Israel had no choice but to
acknowledge that Zakariyah (as) was entitled to assume the
guardianship of Maryam (as) Maryam (as) grew up as a faithful
follower of Allah (swt). Even when she was a child, she was
always found in a state of prayer. (----No dialogue---) She stayed in seclusion,
away from the people. Her room was in an enclosure, within
Bait-al Maqdis specially built for her. (----No dialogue---) There was something magical
about this little girl. Every time the Prophet walked
in to check on Her, He always found her surrounded by
 an abundance of food! (----No dialogue---) “I did not bring this food for her!”
He wondered “Then where did all this food come from?” And strangely, the fruits before
her were not of this climate. But they were still fresh! “O Maryam”
 He asked “From where are these fruits
 coming to you?” “It is from Allah (swt)”
replied the little girl Even though the Prophet believed the
little girl, He still had his doubts (----No dialogue----) This incident repeated many times, and
finally the Prophet asked her once again. (----No dialogue----) “It is from Allah (swt)”
replied Maryam (as). “Indeed, Allah provides for whom
He wills without account” She said (----No dialogue----) When the Prophet saw these
 miracles repeatedly, it reaffirmed His faith in Allah (swt). He knew Allah (swt) had the
power to do anything, no matter what the
conditions are. (---No dialogue---) The Prophet always wanted a child, who
could continue His legacy of Prophethood. But he was now ninety years old, (---No dialogue---) and so was his wife as well. He started praying with utmost
conviction to His Lord! “O Lord, give me from yourself an heir,  who shall inherit me, and inherit also
the posterity of Yaqub” (---No dialogue---) “And make him my Lord, one with
whom you are well pleased” (---No dialogue---) And very soon, Allah(swt)
responded to his prayers. One day, when the Prophet was
praying, the angels came to him (---No dialogue---) “O Zakariyah!” said the angels. “We are here to share a good news
 about your son! His name shall be Yahya! Allah himself has named Him, and this name has never
existed in history!” But when the Prophet heard
this, he got confused! “My Lord” he said to the angels. “How can I have a son when my wife
is barren, and I an old man?” The Prophet said this not because
He didn’t believe, but it was more of an exclamation
of surprise!! “Such is Allah, He does what
He wills” said the Angel “Can you show me a sign?” He asked the Angel And the Angel replied (----No dialogue---) “Your sign is that you shall not
speak to anyone for three nights!” (----No dialogue---) “You can talk to them
only in gestures. And remember your Lord, and glorify
Him in the morning and afternoon” (----No dialogue---) When the Prophet came out of the room,
he realized he couldn’t talk anymore! He had to talk to the
people using gestures!! (----No dialogue---) After a few months, like Allah(swt)
had promised, His wife soon gave birth to a boy! They named Him Yahya (as) (----No dialogue---) Masha Allah, that was
such an amazing story! (---Baba laughing---) Do you believe now that nothing
is impossible with Allah (swt) Yes I do! Alright, now let me ask
you a few questions I’m ready! Tell me what was the
profession of Zachariah (as)? (----No dialogue---) He was a carpenter! That’s correct! Now can you tell me which
family He belonged to? He belonged to the
family of Sulaiman (as) That’s right again! (----No dialogue---) Who was the father
of Maryam (as)? Imran (as)! He was the father
of Maryam (as)! Isnt it right? Yes my son, you are right. How was Zachariah (as) chosen to
be the guardian of Maryam (as)? They chose Him by casting lots! That’s right again! Now tell me what name did Allah(swt)
give for the Prophet’s son? (---No dialogue---) He was named Yahya (as)! That’s very good my son. Its getting late, come on, lets go back home! (---No dialogue---)"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum- Assalam! How are you Amir? I’m fine Baba.. Will you tell me the
remaining story today? Of course I will tell you the
remaining story of Prophet Musa (as). Now where did we stop yesterday? You told me till how God sent the
final sign to the people of Egypt. And what was that? It was the sign of blood! God turned Nile water into blood! That’s very good! Inshallah! I will
start from there… Listen carefully! Bismillah The Story of Exodus! The Egyptians refused to believe in Allah,
 inspite of the miracles that Musa (as) performed. God sent his punishments
repeatedly, and the people would appeal to Musa (as),
 promising to release Israelites. But time and again, they
broke their promises Finally, God withdrew His mercy,  and gave order for Musa to lead his people
 out of Egypt. The people carried their jewels and
their other belongings with them. This mass migration was
later known as Exodus. In the darkness of the night, the Prophet
led his people towards the Red Sea. By now, Pharaoh realized that the
Israelites had left the city. He got really angry, and he assembled an
army to follow and capture the Israelites. By early morning, the Israelites
had reached the Red Sea. When the Prophet looked back, He could
see the army getting closer and closer. He realized that they were
soon going to get trapped. In front of them was the Red Sea, and
to their back was Pharaoh’s army! Fear and panic began to
spread through the people! Musa (as) walked towards the edge of the
Red Sea and looked out at the horizon. It was then that Yusha(as)
turned to the Prophet and asked “In front of us is this
impassable barrier- the sea! And our enemy is
approaching from behind! Surely, death cannot be avoided! But the Prophet did not panic. He stood silently and waited for God 
to keep his promise-  to free the children of Israel! At that moment Allah(swt) commanded the
 Prophet to strike the sea with His staff! Musa (as) did as
he was commanded. A fierce wind began to blow, the sea began to swirl and spin! And suddenly, the sea parted revealing
a path for people to walk!! It was a miracle!! The Prophet then led his
people across the sea. As they walked, the waves stood
like a mountain on each side! The Prophet ensured that
everyone crossed the sea safely. When He looked back, He could see the
pharaoh and his men approaching. The Pharaoh and his army had
seen this miracle as well. But the Pharaoh was a pretender. He wanted to take the credit for this
miracle, so he shouted to his men “Look! The sea has opened at my
command, so that we may arrest them” They rushed across the parted
waters following the Israelites. But when they reached midway, the water came crashing on them! Pharaoh realized that
he was going to die. He shouted out of fear “I believe that
there is no God other than Allah, and I surrender to You” But it was too late. The curtain fell on the
Pharaoh’s tyranny, and the waves carried
his body to the shore. When the Egyptians
saw his dead body, they realized that the man they
 had worshipped could not even keep away his own death! They now knew that
he was never a god! God had favored the children of Israel,
and he led them safely out of Egypt. After a few days of walking in
the desert, they got thirsty. God then commanded the Prophet
to strike a rock with his staff! It was a miracle! There came twelve different
springs of water from the rock! Each spring was meant for
twelve different tribes, God did this so that there won’t be
any dispute while sharing the water. God also sent clouds to protect
them from the scorching sun. And when they were hungry, He sent a special delicious
food called ‘Manna’ But in spite of
God’s generosity, many people kept complaining
to the Prophet. Musa (as) scolded the people and reminded them
that they had just left a life of slavery. He asked them to be happy instead,
and thank God for His generosity. The children of Israelites
were broken people, unable to stay away from
sin and corruption. They were tired of Manna, and
tired of the travelling. They wondered if there was really
a place called Caanan after all! The people kept travelling through
the desert for days and days. They were walking with no destination,
day and night, morning and evening. Eventually they
entered the Sinai. The Prophet realized that this was the place where
he had spoken to God before his journey to Egypt. Musa(as) decided to
climb the mountain. So He called His brother, and asked Him to take charge of the 
people while He was gone. But before climbing
the mountain, God ordered the Prophet
to fast for thirty days. On the thirtieth day, God, then asked
the Prophet to fast for ten more days. After the fast was completed, Musa (as) was
ready to speak to the Lord once again. He then started
climbing the mountain. The climb was long
and difficult. Once He reached the top,
God gave him two tablets, in which the special laws to govern
the Israelites were written! Musa (as) had gone for forty days,
and the people grew restless. They were like children, complaining
and acting impulsively. Among them, there was a man named Samiri,
who was more inclined towards the evil. He suggested that they
needed another guide, and he told them that the
Prophet had deserted them “In order to find true
guidance, you need a true God” He shouted to the Israelites. “I shall provide you one” He started collecting all
their jewelry at first. Then he dug a hole on the ground,
in which he placed a lot, and put all the jewelry inside. Then he lit a fire! Samiri then made a golden
calf out of the molten metal It was as if they had
succeeded in making a God! Haroon (as), the brother of the Prophet was
afraid to stand up to the people at first. But when he saw the
idol, he spoke up “You are committing a grave
sin” he shouted to them. He warned them of the
consequences for their actions. “We shall stop worshipping this God
only when Musa returns” They replied Those who remained true to their belief
separated themselves from the idol worshippers. They stood along
with Haroon (as) When Musa (as) returned, he saw his
people dancing around the idol! His heart was filled with
shame and anger now! He threw the tablets to
the ground in his anger. He then tugged Haroon’s
beard and his hair crying “What held you back when you saw
 them doing this?”  “Why did you not fight them?” “O son of my mother, let
go of my beard” “They were about to kill me!” The Prophet understood
Haroon’s helplessness, and he began to handle the
situation calmly and wisely. He called Samiri and said
“Get away from here” “You shall live the rest
of your life alone” The Prophet sent him
to exile forever He knew that God was going to punish
them for worshipping the idol. So He chose seventy seniors from
each tribe and ordered them “Rush towards Allah and
repent for what you have done” He then started climbing Mount Sinai
 with the seventy elders. Once they reached the top, the Prophet
asked the elders to wait for him, and he walked ahead. There he started
communicating with God. The elders could hear Musa speaking with
the God, but they could not see Him. The Prophet returned after
sometime, and the elders told him “O Musa! We shall never believe in
you until we see Allah(swt) ourselves!” Their stubborn demand was rewarded
with punishing thunderbolts, and an earthquake that killed
all of them instantly!! The Prophet was very sad now. He wondered what he would say
to the children of Israelites. Those seventy men were
the best of the people. So he turned to God, and
prayed for forgiveness. Allah(swt) heard his prayers, and He
raised the dead people back to life. The children of Israel wandered
in the desert for many years. The Prophet suffered greatly because
of the ignorance of his people!. He suffered everything for
the sake of his people. God never let them reach the promised land because of the sins committed 
by the Israelites. After a few years,
 Prophet Haroon (as) died, while they were wandering in the desert. When the time of death
for Musa (as) arrived, the angel of death was
sent to the Prophet. When the angel came to the Prophet,
he slapped him on the eye!! The angel returned
to Lord and said “You had sent me to a slave
who didn’t want to die! Then Allah(swt) said
“Return to him now. When you meet him, ask him to put
his hand on the back of an ox. Tell him that for every hair that 
comes under his arm, he will be granted one year of life! The angel returned to the Prophet
and gave him Allah’s message “What will happen after that?” “Death” said the Angel “Then let it come now”
replied the Prophet. The Prophet then requested Allah(swt)
to let him die close to the Holy Land, so that He could atleast
see it from a distance Allah(swt) granted his request,
and he died shortly after Prophet Musa (as) , the one to whom
Allah(swt) spoke directly, met his death with a contended soul 
and a faithful heart. Mashallah! That was
such an amazing story! The Story of Prophet Musa (as)
was really inspiring, wasn’t it? Yes, it was Baba! Now shall I start asking
you a few questions? Why did the Prophet leave Egypt
along with the Israelites? The Egyptians never heeded the Prophet’s
request to free the Israelites, in spite of the
miracles he performed. That’s why he had to leave Egypt How did the Pharaoh die? God parted the red sea, for the Prophet 
and the Israelites.  But when the Pharoah entered the river, 
the water came crashing down on him. Very good my son. Now tell me what was written on the
tablets that God gave the Prophet God gave him two tablets,
 in which the special laws to govern the Israelites were written! Masha Allah! 
That was the right answer. That’s all for today my son! I will tell you another
story tomorrow! Good night my son! Good night Baba"
"Assalamu Alaykum! Wa-alaikum s-salam! Baba, 
I was waiting for you!  What were you doing my son? I was just finishing up
 my homework Baba And, have finished it yet? Almost baba, just 
one more line to write. Alright, finish your homework,
 and Insha allah,  I will tell you the story of 
another prophet tonight. Story of another prophet! 
Thank you so much baba! Just give me a minute, and 
I’ll finish writing this quickly! I  finished my homework Baba, can you please tell the story now? Mashallah, that was quick! So excited ? Alright, tonight I am going 
to tell you the story of Prophet Nuh (as)! Who was he Baba? I’ll tell you my son..
 Now listen carefully! Bismillah! Allah (swt) sent Prophet Nuh (as)
 to earth one thousand years after 
sending Prophet Adam (as) The population on earth
 had increased many folds by now. And by this time,the evil Shaytan
 had played his dirty tricks with mankind, and people had started 
worshipping idols. It was during this time that Allah sent another prophet to earth, Prophet Nuh (as) to guide the people back! But it wasn’t going to be 
an easy job for the prophet. “Fear Allah, and do what Allah says” shouted the prophet to everyone. But the people didn’t want to listen. They shaked their heads, and 
continued worshipping the idols. The prophet was an excellent speaker and he was very patient too. “Don’t you understand that 
it was Allah who created this whole world?”
 shouted the prophet. “It was Allah who created the sun, the moon and the stars you see in the sky. He created the rivers,
 the mountains, the trees and everything that you see around. 
He did all this  for you,and you alone. Then why are you not showing
 him any respect? Why are you worshipping these idols? But the people turned their backs 
on him saying “Ha.. Who are you to advice us.
You are just another man, and we think that you are lying. 
Go away, and leave us alone. But there were good
 muslims on earth too! Most of them were weak, and poor. They listened to the words
 of the prophet and realized that they were 
 committing a sin by worshipping the idols Now there were two different
 group of people on earth. One who worshipped Allah (swt), and the others who continued 
idol worship Nuh continued preaching
 to the people for many years. The idol worshippers soon
 became tired of the prophet. “You’ve been preaching lies 
for long enough” they said. “We are going to stone you
 if you do not stop” But the prophet ignored them, and 
continued calling the people tirelessly.  He preached to them during
 the day, and the night. On many occasions, he was stoned by
 the idol worshippers, while preaching to the crowd He was even beaten with the sticks! “You are no different from us” 
shouted the idol worshippers. “You are no prophet! 
You are just another man, and why should we listen to you?” “I’m telling you the truth” 
the prophet pleaded to them. “You are committing a sin
 by worshipping the idols” But the people didn’t listen 
and they beat him again! “I fear for you! 
Allah is going to punish you one day” the prophet shouted to them But the people had no shame, 
and they said “he is a fool, don’t listen to him” All this pain did not let the Prophet 
to stop calling out to the people. He continued preaching to them for 
for nine hundred and fifty years! The disbelievers kept making
 fun of the prophet, and by now they had taken
 things too far! Nuh (as) was disappointed by now. Whereas the number of disbelievers 
kept growing and growing. One night when the prophet 
 was offering his prayers, Allah spoke to him!! “Don’t be sad Nuh” 
God said to the prophet “You have done what you
 were asked to. I am going to punish all the people o
n the earthfor their wrongdoings. Everyone on earth is going to die, except the muslims and 
the animals” said Allah (swt). As the first step, God then asked the prophet
 to plant many trees! Nuh (as) didn’t understand 
the reason behind this, but he listened to Allah, and started
 planting trees as he was told. He also asked the good muslims,
 who listened to him him to do the same. They did this for more than 
one hundred years! After many years, Allah spoke
 to the prophet again! This time he asked the Prophet
 to start building a ship!! “It has to be a huge ship,
 that can accommodate a pair of every animal 
on this earth” said Allah. The prophet was confused. He didn’t know how to build a ship, and no one had ever made
 a ship before! In spite of this, the prophet 
started making the ship with the help of Makers. First they
 made plans for building the ship No one knows the exact size
 of the ship, some say it had a length of 600ft, 
and others say it had a length of 2400ft!! Whatever it was,
the ship was sure going to be gigantic one! “We will help you to build the ship” said his children, and the muslims, 
and they joined the prophet. First, the prophet had to choose
 a place for building the ship He chose the mountains far
 far away from the city. The prophet collected the tools, 
and set out to build the ship They started cutting down
 the trees for wood. Yes, it was the same trees he that he had planted more than a hundred
 years back! Then they started building the
 ship as per the plan The men worked very hard, 
day and night to build the ship. When the disbelievers 
saw the prophet building a ship on top of a mountain, 
they started making fun of him! You are such an old fool” they said.. “Why would you possibly 
need a ship so huge” The others said “And how are you 
going to take it to the sea?” The others said “And how are you 
going to take it to the sea?” “You would come to know very soon”
 replied the prophet. The people didn’t know
 why the prophet was building the ship, and they thought 
that the prophet had lost his mind! The prophet and his men kept
 working hard. After many months, 
the ship was finally ready! They then thanked Allah for 
helping them to finish the ship The time for flood was
 nearing day by day. One night Allah told the prophet that he will start flooding the earth, the day when the prophet sees water 
coming out of the stove in his house! You see, this huge ship built 
by the Prophet had three different sections! What were the different 
sections for Baba? They were for different types
 of animals Amir. The first one was for birds. The second part of the structure
 was for humans, and the third part was for animals. Mashallah..... that was brilliant Yes my son And while the day of the 
flood got nearer, animals and the birds started 
arriving one by one! They were arriving in pairs- 
 one male and a female! There were elephants, giraffes,
 lions, rabbits, parrots and soon the ship was filled
 with all the variety of  animals and birds from earth! And one day, like God had 
told the prophet, water suddenly started coming
 out of the stove in his kitchen This was the sign Nuh (as) 
was waiting for! He knew that the time 
of flood had arrived! When he went out, he saw 
that it had started raining too! Without wasting anytime,
 he ran out and called  all the good muslims who had 
helped himto build the ship. He asked all of them to board 
the ship immediately. The disbelievers didn’t understand what was going on, so they 
kept laughing at the prophet. “Look at the old fool” they said. “What is he going to do with
 all those animals and men” The prophet ignored them and asked his wives and sons to board 
the ship quickly. Everyone obeyed him, 
except for one of his wife, and her son who were 
not his followers.. “I will save myself from the water” his son said. “Don’t worry 
about me” The water levels had gone up by now, so the prophet ran to
 board the ship. A terrible flood broke out, and the 
water levels began to rise rapidly. The earths crust moved,
 and ocean floors started rising which caused it to flood the dry lands!! The rains didn’t stop for hours either! By now people realized that what 
 the prophet told them was true, and they ran toward the 
 mountains to save themselves. The prophet saw that his
 wife and son were climbing a mountain to escape from the water. So he shouted to them “COME AND BOARD THE SHIP,
 SAVE YOURSELF!” But they ignored him and climbed
 to the top of the mountain. Then a huge wave, bigger
 than the mountain they stood on, came and hit them, 
killing both of them!! These enormous waves killed
 all other disbelievers as well!! The water kept rising and rising, and after sometime, the earth was
 completely filled with water! Then Nuh (as) said “Bismillah”! When the prophet uttered these
 words, the ship started moving! The rains had stopped by now, but the entire earth was filled
 with water. The prophet knew that he had 
to keep sailing for a long long time But didn’t the animals hurt others? How did they live together? The ship had eighty people in it, and the prophet had taken
 precautions to store enough food for the men and the animals. Allah had it all planned my son. He made the ship suitable for the 
silent sheep as well as the violent lion! all the violent animals were 
down with some or the other sickness All of them were living together, but the prophet faced a lot of
 trouble because of the rats. They were everywhere,
 running up and down, nibbling there, nibbling here.. They were really the troublemakers. Then the prophet prayed to God, and it was then that Allah
 created the cats! The cats hunted down the rats, and after sometime, the rats 
started behaving as well. Like that Allah (swt) solved
 many problems that the prophet had to face
 during the journey. They had sailed for about one
 hundred and fifty days by now, and they couldn’t find land 
anywhere they could see. The prophet and the men waited
 and waited for many days The prophet then decided to send
 a crow to see if it could find land anywhere. But the crow didn’t return at all Then the prophet sent a dove in
 search of the land. The dove flew away, and after 
a few days returned with a  branch of olive tree in its beaks! The prophet and his family were
 really happy, as they knew that they were 
close to the land! The ship sailed further for sometime, and finally reached on top 
of the Joodi mountain. The prophet said “Bismillah”,
 and the ship stopped moving! After travelling for more than
 one hundred and fifty days, their journey had finally 
come to an end The prophet released all the animals, 
 birds and insects first into the land. They went out and populated
 the earth back again. The prophet and other muslims
 came out of the ship, and the first thing he did was 
to put his foreheadto the ground in prostration! And that was a new beginning
 for the human race! That was such a great story Baba! Masha Allah.. I’m glad you
 liked it my son Now shall I ask a few questions
 from the story? Yes baba! Alright, now tell me why did Allah 
(swt) send Prophet Nuh (As) to earth? He send the prophet to call
 people back to allah (swt) That’s correct my son.
 Now for the next question, why did the people not listen
 to the words of the prophet? The people on earth thought 
the prophet was lying to them. They thought the prophet was 
just another man like them. Very good amir! Can you tell me who boarded the
 ship along with the prophets family? I know the answer. The muslims boarded the ship too! 
The animals, birds and the insects boarded the ship in pairs as well! That’s correct again.
And now for the final question. Tell me the name of the mountain 
where the ship finally landed Was it Joodi mountain Baba? You are right my son. Mashallah you gave me
 all the right answers Thanks Baba! Alright, that’s all for today, I’ll tell you another story 
tomorrow my son. Ma asalama"
"Assalamu Alaikum. Walaikum Assalam Baba. My son.. Do you want to hear the stories
of the Prophets today? Stories of Prophets? Masha Allah..! That sounds great Please tell me Baba.. Inshah Allah..! How about I tell you the story of the
first Prophet to live today? Do you want to hear that story? The story of the first Prophet..? Masha Allah...! Please tell me the 
story Baba.. Hahaha.. Alright. Now before I start the story let me ask you a question. This is getting very interesting. Go ahead Baba.. Ask me the question Alright..now tell me Do you know who was the first man
 to live on earth? Can you give me a clue, please..? Hahaha.. Alright, here are
some options. Was it Adam (AS), Kane or Iblis? I know the answer. It was Adham (AS) Masha Alllah..
You are right my son! Alright, now let me
start the story Bismillah..! A long long time ago.. Allah (T) created the sun. The moon, and the earth. After creating these, he saw that his creation
was incomplete. So he asked his angels to collect
clay from the earth. The obedient angels collected clay and Allah made a man
like figure with it. And the god named him
Adam (AS) But the figure didn't move for
 forty long years. It just stood
still there. When Iblis saw this figure, he was confused and scared. And after forty long years
one day.. Allah (T) breathed his spirit into Adham (AS)! When the spirit reached
the head of the figure, it sneezed. When the spirit reached his eyes, he saw all the amazing food
 lying around. Then the spirit reached
 his stomach. And Adham (AS) felt hungry. The Prophet had seen the
fruits lying around So before the spirit could even
 reach his legs, he jumped towards the fruits. Adham (AS) fell down as he
couldn't move his legs. Then, Allah asked all the angels
including Iblis to prostrate before Adham (AS)
as a sign of respect. One by one all the angels prostrated
before the Prophet except Iblis! Iblis said that he was better
than the Prophet and he was made from fire. Allah got angry with
this disobedience so he banished Iblis
from paradise. From that day, Iblis was called
as the Shaytan! And he was thrown into the hell! Shaytan was now very angry
 with the humans as he was banished from
the paradise. Because of them, he wowed to take revenge by
misleading the humans. Allah then taught Adam the names of every animal
in paradise. The lion, the sheep, camel Elephant,dove,peacock and
many many more.. Allah told the Prophet that he was allowed to eat every
 fruit in the garden except one. God told the Prophet that he should not eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge and that it was forbidden and he spent most of his time playing with the animals in paradise. After a few years, the
 Prophet became lonely as there were no other
 humans in paradise. Allah (T) saw this. So he decided to give
 Adam (AS) a wife. That night when the Prophet
 was sleeping God created the first woman. When the Prophet woke up he was happy to see the woman He then named her Hawwa, because she was made
from something living. Both of them lived happily in
 paradise for a long time. Shaythan was still angry
at the humans. Many years had passed by. So Shaytan knew that the Prophet must have forgotten the 
words of Allah (T) One day.. made a plan that would 
banish the Prophet and his wife from paradise. Shaytan came to the paradise and tricked the Prophet
and his wife into eating the forbidden fruit. The Prophet and his wife unknowingly
 plucked the fruit and started eating it. But even before they could
 finish eating the fruit they knew they had committed a grave sin. They were now filled with pain Sadness and shame After eating the fruit of
forbidden knowledge they realized they 
were naked. For they ran to cover
themselves upon leaves They were now really scared. As they knew Allah would  punish
 him for their disobedience. When Allah (T) came to
 know about this he got angry. He got angry And the Prophet and his wife were
thrown out of the paradise. The Prophet and his wife walked
for a very long time And they finally settled down
near a river. The Prophet knew that the life on earth
was going to be very difficult He had to make a house
for them to live. He had to work hard to 
feed his family. They, now no longer have the pleasures
 they enjoyed in paradise After a few years Hawwa gave birth to  twins- a boy and a girl. They named the boy Qabil and later Hawwa gave birth to
 another twins. Again a boy and a girl This time they named
 the boy Habil. Both Habil and Kabil grew up Qabil took to farming working in the fields and growing crops When Habil grew up he became a shepherd and took care of the sheeps. When Habil and Qabil grew up to
become adults the Prophet decided to
 get them married. Since there were no other 
females on earth Prophet decided to get Qabil married
 to Habil's twin and Habil to Qabil's twin Qabil's twin sister was beautiful. while Haabil's sister was not
that  beautiful Qabil was not happy with
 the arrangement And he wanted to marry
 his own sister. There was an argument And the Prophet decided to settle the issue
 by offering a sacrifice to Allah (T) It was decided that the one who's
 sacrifice is accepted will marry Qabil's sister. Habil collected the best lamb
 from his cloak and offered it as a
 sacrifice to Allah (T) But Qabil didn't want to offer the  best
 fruits and vegetables as sacrifice. Instead he chose the bad vegetables
 and grains for sacrifice Allah (T) accepted the 
sacrifice of Habil. But rejected the one
 made by Qabil. The Prophet was present when they
made their sacrifices. And it was decided that Habil
would marry Qabil's sister. But Qabil was not at all happy He was so angry that he
wanted to kill Habil One day Habil was late
coming home. And the Prophet send Qabil
to search for him Qabil went searching for Habil and he went to the fields looking for Habil. Atlast he found Habil walking
towards home Qabil was still angry
 with Habil. ""Your offering was accepted but mine was not"" to which Haabil replied ""Allah  only accepts from
those who fear him."" Qabil was angry to hear this and he picked up a stone to hit Habil Habil saw this and eventhough he was
 bigger and stronger than Qabil He said,"" Even if you stretch
your hand to kill me I will never stretch my hands
to harm you. Because I fear Allah"" This comment further angered Qabil, and he struck him with the stone,
 instantly killing him! When Qabil realized that
 Habil was dead, he was terrified and didn’t
know what to do! He didn’t want his father to know
 what he has done,  so he started thinking about
 ways to hide his sin. Qabil wandered from place to place with
the dead body of Habil trying to hide it. That was when he saw two crows
 fighting with each other. During the fight, one crow
killed the other, and the dead one fell down. The victorious crow then scratched and
dug a hole in the ground!  He buried the dead crow in the
 hole he had dug. Then he filled the hole 
with mud. This gave Qabil an idea, and like the crows, he dug a hole on the ground, and buried his brothers body in it. This was the first burial of a man. Qabil was ashamed of what 
he had done. Shaytan had won over him, and he knew that he could no longer
 go back to his family. The prophet knew what
 had happened and he mourned the
 loss of his son. He had lost both his sons- one was dead, and the other was misled
 by Shaytan! He warned his other children
about Shaytan, and asked them to always obey the
 commands of Allah (T) After a long long time, the prophet had many
 more children! The prophet had grown old, and  his children loved
 him very much. When Adam (AS) realized that his
 death was near, he appointed Seth as the
 successor to his family At the time of his death, the angels came to his house and
 stood beside him. When the prophet realized that the angel 
of death had arrived, he smiled peacefully and
passed away Masha Allah, that was such
 a wonderful story! Alhamdulillah..  I’m glad you
 liked this story Now shall I ask you a few questions to 
see if you remember the story? Of course yes! 
Go on.. ask me! Hmmm.. Now tell me the name of
 the first human  god had created It was Adam (AS) That’s great dear.. And tell me the name of his wife It was Hawwa! You’ve got that right Alright, now for the next question. Tell me why the prophet was banned 
from the paradise? They were banned because they ate the
 fruit of forbidden knowledge. That’s why God threw them 
out of the paradise. Isn't that right Baba? That’s correct my dear! Now for the next question. Tell me the names of the
 Prophet’s first sons It was Qabil and Habil Masha Allah.. You are giving all the 
right answers my son! Hmm.. let me see if you
 can answer this one. What was the profession of Qabil? Hmmm.. he was a farmer! That’s correct! And now for the last question- Whom did the prophet appoint as the
 successor to his family? Oh.. Can you give me some 
clues baba? Ha haa.. Alright, here are the clues Was it Qabil, Habil, or Seth? Seth! It was Seth Baba! Isn't that right? Yes dear.. Alhamdullilah you are 
such a bright boy. Now that’s all for today. Inshallah, I will tell you another
 story tomorrow Ma as-salama Good night Baba.."
"Assalamu Alaikum Walaikum Assalam Are you ready for the
story of Prophet today? Yes Baba, I am! Insha Allah, I will tell you the story of Prophet Isa
(as) and The Food Spread from the Sky! Bismillah! Prophet Isa (as) and The
Food Spread from the Sky! Prophet Isa (as) had been following Torah
until He received the revelation from God. God gave him a new
book, the Injil! The Prophet read this book ,
which had been gifted to Him When the Prophet announced that He
had received a new book from God, the people who still followed
Torah, did not like this. Like all other Prophets, Prophet Isa
(as) too performed many miracles. Allah(swt) sent all the prophets with
miracles as a proof to their prophethood. This way the people could witness, know about them, and believe in
their prophethood. Many of the miracles that Prophet Isa
(as) performed were by curing illness. The people during this time were quite
knowledgeable in the field of medicine, and when the Prophet cured the sick
who were declared untreatable, it sent out a strong message Once He put His hand on the face
of a man who was born blind. The Prophet cured this man, and
He could see for the first time! One day when the Prophet was walking to the
town, he saw a procession taking place The Prophet approached them, and asked them
what was going on. “This man is dead, and we are
taking him to the burial site” replied one of them The Prophet asked them to stop,
and prayed to Allah(swt) It was a miracle! The dead man stood up,
and He was alive!! Allah brought this person
back to life just like that!! One day, Prophet Isa(as) asked His
supporters to fast for 30 days. His followers agreed and
they started fasting Upon completion of thirty
days fasting period, the followers went along with
 Isa (as) to the desert. It was normal for thousands of people to
 follow the Prophet, wherever He went. Many of the followers were sick people,
who hoped to be cured by the Prophet A group of people who were against
the teachings of the Prophet, also followed the Prophet
wherever He went. They followed Him so that they could
 mock at the Prophet,  and belittle Him at every
opportunity they got! After the thirty day fasting period,  the disbelievers asked the
Prophet,  if they could have a spread of
food from the sky. They asked for this,  as a confirmation that the God had
 accepted their fast. They wanted to eat something special
on the day the broke their fast. They also wanted the spread
to be enough for all of them! There were thousands of
 people present there, and the disbelievers knew that the Prophet
 could never deliver what they had asked for Prophet Isa (as) agreed
to their request, and He went to a silent spot,
and prayed to Allah (swt). It was a miracle! God accepted the
prayers of Prophet!! A huge spread of food descended
right from the sky!! There was one cloud below the
spread, and one cloud above it! And it was surrounded
by the angels! Slowly it came down to the ground,  and as it descended, the Prophet remained immersed
 in His prayers! The spread of food
landed near the Prophet. There was a white cloth
covering the spread! The Prophet took this off saying “in the
name of Allah, the Best Sustainer!” When the cloth covering the
 spread was taken off, the people gathered around
looked at in wonder! There were seven big fish, seven loaves of bread, vinegar, salt, honey and many
 other fruits as well! The spread had a wonderful smell, the people had never smelled anything
 so wonderful before!! The Prophet then asked the
disbelievers to eat from the spread. But the they replied
 “We will not eat from it, until we see you eating from this spread” “You are the ones who asked for it”
 the Prophet asked them “Then you should eat
the food first” But the disbelievers
still refused! The Prophet then asked the poor,  the sick, the handicapped and the
 blind to eat from the spread. There were more than one thousand of them, and all of them ate from the spread! Then another miracle took place! All the sick people who ate
from the spread got cured! Same was the case with the
handicapped, the blind and all others! It was a miracle!! The disbelievers were now sad because they had refused
to eat from the spread when they were invited first. The news of the feast
travelled fast, and it reached the city! Thousands of people travelled
to witness this Divine feast!! The number of people who wanted to take
part in the feast had now become so huge! The Prophet then asked them to
take turns to have this feast! Days passed. Each person, from the very first to the
very last, ate until they were full. It is said that almost 7000 people
ate from the feast each day! After forty days, God asked the Prophet to allow only
the poor to eat from the feast,  and not the rich. The Prophet warned the people to be honest,  and asked the rich to stay away
from the feast. He also asked the poor not to take away
the food, to save for the next day. However the people didn’t
listen to the Prophet. The rich people ate from the
spread, pretending to be poor. And many poor people took the food with
them, disobeying the Prophet’s orders. As a result, the spread of food was lifted
back into the sky where it came from!! The people talked about this
miracle for many years, and they were convinced about
Allah’s miracles! By the time Prophet Isa (as) was
thirty three years old, the priests had become very angry at him and they made plans to kill the prophet. One night, the Prophet was sitting along
with His twelve companions in His house. He said “One among you
is going to betray me” It was true! And it was
none other than Judas! Judas had gone to meet the
head priest that day. “What will you give me if I deliver
Isa to you” Judas asked the Priest “We will give you thirty pieces of
shekels” the head priest replied Judas was ashamed of himself,
and he left the room The Prophet then asked any one of His
companionswas ready to take His place, as the soldiers were coming to arrest him “Who among you will be ready to take
 my place?”  asked the Prophet “You will be my companion in paradise!” A young man stood up,
and readily agreed. When the soldiers arrived to
arrest the Prophet, they took the young man instead,
 and crucified him! Before the young man was crucified,  Prophet Isa (as) was raised from a window
 in the corner of the house. Prophet Isa (as) is now alive
 in the second heaven. He shall descend before the
Day of judgement. Masha Allah That was
such a wonderful story! I’m glad you liked it my son! Now are you ready
for the questions? Yes Baba, I am! Alright, now tell me the name of the
new book that God gave the Prophet It was Injil! Excellent Amir, that
is the right answer! Can you tell me some of the
miracles that the Prophet performed The Prophet cured a leper,  He gave sight to a blind man,  then He raised a man
back from the dead..  and… and yes!  He brought a food spread from the sky! Masha Allah  That’s amazing! That’s all for today.  Insha Allah  I will tell you the story of
Prophet Muhammad (saw) tomorrow That’s wonderful,
I’m so excited!! Good night my son Good night Baba!"
"It is a good day today, 
isn’t it? Yes Baba.. It is.. Baba, Look.. Look over there!  That’s a deer..
Where did it come from? Oh, she’s so beautiful! Yes my son.. She’s so beautiful! That’s the brilliance of Allah’s creations! I agree Baba! Which story are you going
to tell me today Baba?  Insha Allah, I will tell you the story of 
two different Prophets today. First I will start with the story of
 Prophet Yusha (as) Listen carefully Bismillah! The Story of Prophet Yusha (as) Prophet Yusha (as) was the
grandson of Prophet Musa (as). He joined his grandfather during
 the great Exodus. Musa (as) liked his grandson, and gave him
 many important duties. They wandered in the
desert for 40 long years! When the Old Prophet died,  Prophet Yusha (as) took over the 
role of leading the Israelites. They travelled for many days, and finally
reached the banks of river Jordan. Yusha (as) led the people, and they crossed
the river to reach the town of Jericho Jericho was a magnificent city with
 towering building and great walls. The people in the town
were very huge and strong! But their leaders were very bad, 
and they were all very corrupt. They cheated the poor, and they worshipped
 idols as well! God didn’t want these bad
people controlling the city. Allah(swt) then ordered the Prophet to
take his men to capture the city The Prophet recruited young men from his
people and planned to attack Jericho He took his men and set to seize
the city of Jericho on a Friday The leaders of Jericho
too sent out their army. Yusha (as) and his men fought the
 strong army very bravely.  They fought the army throughout the
morning, afternoon and evening. When the sun started to set,
the Prophet started worrying. He knew that the next day was Saturday, 
the day of the Sabbath, and it was a holy day
for them.  His men would not fight on the Sabbath 
day, so he prayed to Allah (swt) “Oh Allah, hold the sun back
from setting” He prayed It was a miracle!  The sun didn’t set for hours, and it 
stood up there in the sky just like that! The Prophet and his men fought fiercely,
and they eventually won the battle! And through the example of Yusha (as), we see how Allah(swt) grants victory to
 those who are prepared! Masha Allah! That was
such a wonderful story When did the Prophet die Baba? He lived till the age of hundred And it is believed that he
 died in Palestine. Thank you Baba for
telling me this story. Now shall I ask a few
questions from this story? Yes, I’m ready! Alright, now tell who was the
grandfather of Prophet Yusha (as)  He was the grandson of
Prophet Musa (as) Very good. Now tell me the name of the
river they had to cross while in the desert It was River Jordan, wasn’t it? After crossing the river,
which city did they reach? They reached the
city of Jericho! You’re right again! Now tell me on what day did the Prophet
take his men to attack the city? It was on a Friday!!  You’re giving all
the right answers my son. Now answer this, why wouldn’t the
men fight during the next day? Because it was the day of
the Sabbath, a holy day! Alright, and here is the last question. How did Allah (swt) help the
 Prophet to win the war? God stopped the sun from setting
till the Prophet won the war! Masha Allah! All of your
answers were correct! Thanks Baba Didn’t you say that you will
tell me another story today? Yes my son! Inshallah I will tell you
the story of Prophet Hizqeel (as) now Mashallah! 
Another story? Now listen carefully! Bismillah! The Story of Prophet
Hizqeel (as) After the death of Prophet Yusha (as), Prophet Hizqeel (as) succeeded him as the
 Prophet to the Israelites A long time after the death of 
Prophet Yusha (as), the Israelites were now living in Palestine It was during this time, that
a plague attacked the village People started dying everywhere,
and everyone was scared! The people gathered their family and
 belongings, and started fleeing from the village. Allah(swt) was really angry when he saw
 the people running away, thinking of saving themselves They travelled for many days, and
eventually settled on top of a plateau. It was then that the angel of death
called to them “DIE, YOU ALL” Every one of the survivors perished
on that plateau the same day Many centuries had passed by now, and the place where the survivors
 died was called Damardan! The plateau was covered with
bones of all the dead people One day a Prophet named Hizqeel (as)
was walking through the plateau. He was surprised to see so
many bones lying around. He stood there for a long time
wondering what had happened. Then suddenly,
there came a voice “Do you want me to show you how I bring
them back to life?” asked the Voice “Yes” answered the Prophet. His idea was to marvel at the power
 of Allah(swt)! First, the voice commanded Prophet to
 say these words “O bones, Allah(swt) commands you 
to gather up” The Prophet said the words as he
 was ordered.  Then the bone started flying here and there, 
to gather up, and they became skeletons! Then the voice commanded the
 Prophet to say this “O bones, it is an order of Allah(swt) 
for you to wear flesh, and clothes in which you died in” The Prophet said this, and suddenly, the 
skeletons got covered in flesh and blood!  Then they were covered in clothes!! Then the voice asked the Prophet to 
say these words “O resurrected ones, All of you stand up 
by the command of Allah!” It was a miracle! All of them
came back to life!! The Prophet could not believe his eyes!  There were thousands of people
in front of him, all alive, who were dead just a
 few moments ago!! Masha Allah! That was
such a good story! I’m glad you liked it my son. Alright,
now are you ready for the questions? Yes baba Tell me why did the people
flee from Palestine? It was because of the plague! That’s correct, and did they
survive by running away. No, an angel of death
killed all of them! Very good.. And how did
they come back to life? It was because of the Prophet!  The Prophet said the words as
commanded by a voice, and all of them came back to life!! Masha allah, that was great! You
gave me all the right answers! Thanks Baba! Alright.. I will tell you
another story tomorrow my son Thanks Baba! Good bye Good bye"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! Are you ready for
the story my son? Yes I am! I’m waiting to know
what happened to Talut! Alright my son. The story I’m going
to tell you today is not about Talut, its about another Prophet
named Dawud (as) Who was he Baba? I will tell you now. Do you remember where
we stopped yesterday? Yes! You told me how Talut and his
army faced the army of Philistines! And do you remember who was the
leader of the Philistine army?  It was Goliath, a gigantic man! Masha Allah!
That was wonderful! Now.. Listen carefully Bismillah! The story of Prophet Dawud (as) In the previous episode, we saw how Talut
took a small army to face the Philistines. Many of Talut’s men ran away, when they
saw the huge army of the Philistines. Goliath, the leader of the Philistine army,
was a man of huge build and brute strength. When the two armies faced each
other, Goliath challenged Talut to send anyone from their
army for a single combat. It was a custom in those days where a
 soldier from each side would fight with each other,
 instead of the whole army. “Who is willing to fight for
our side?” Talut asked his men But they were scared, and no one
had enough courage to volunteer. ‘I will marry my daughter to the man
who would fight Goliath” offered Talut But the soldiers remained
silent, and no one volunteered. Talut was upset. He realized that his soldiers
were too scared to fight Goliath. It was then that a small and young
youth stepped forward from the group. “I am ready to fight
Goliath” said the young man When the soldiers saw
him, they laughed at him The young man was none other than Dawud
(as), from the city of Bethlehem. His brothers were soldiers in the army, and
he was the youngest son in his family. His father had sent him
to the battlefield to keep him updated on the news
 at the war front Dawud (as) was given clear
 instructions by his father to not take part in the fighting. Although Talut was very impressed
by the youth’s courage, he said “I admire your courage, but you are
no match for the mighty warrior. Let the mighty men come forward” But Dawud (as) however had already decided,
and he was ready to fight Goliath. He shouted to the King “I killed a Lion, who disturbed my
fathers sleep, yesterday!” “I had also killed a bear not
long ago, all by myself!” “Please do not judge
me by my appearance” Talut was surprised by the
young man’s braveness. “My brave soldier”
He said “If you are willing to fight,  then may Allah(swt)
 guard you and grant you strength” The king asked his men to dress the young Prophet in battle armor,
and to give him a sword But Dawud (as) was not used
to wearing battle dress. He did not feel
comfortable in it at all. It also obstructed
his movements. The soldiers around were quite surprised
when he asked them to remove his armor. He started collecting a few pebbles and
filled his leather pouch within. He then slung it over his
shoulder, next to his sling! Talut was worried by now. “How are you going to defend yourself with
just a sling and few stones?” He asked him “Allah(swt) who protected me from the claws
of the bear, and the fangs of the lion, will certainly protect me from
this brute” replied the Prophet With his wooden staff in his hand,
he began to walk towards the enemy A roar of laughter echoed from the
enemy’s side when they saw him. When Goliath saw the lean man he was about
to fight, he laughed loudly and roared. “Are you out here to play, or
are you tired of your life? I can easily cut off your head
with one swipe of my sword” “You may have armor,  shield and the sword, but I face you
 in the name of Allah(swt), our Lord, whose laws you have mocked” Saying this, he took his sling
and placed a pebble in it. He swung the sling and
aimed at Goliath. The pebble shot from the whirling sling
 with the speed of an arrow,  and hit the Goliath’s head 
with great force. Blood gushed from his forehead. The giant thumped to the ground,  lifeless, even before he had a 
chance to draw his sword. The Philistine army were dumbstruck
when they saw what happened. When they realized that their
 leader was killed, they took off to their heels,
 and ran for their lives. Neither could Talut and the soldiers
believe what happened. They had just won the war! Years of suffering at the hands of
Philistines had come to an end!! The men were overjoyed, and carried
the Prophet back to their country. Dawud (as) had become
a hero overnight. Talut kept his word and married his
daughter Miqel to the young warrior. He appointed Dawud(as) as one
of his chief advisors. Dawud (as) had now become the
most famous man in Israel! The sudden fame never
got into his head. He was not a prisoner of fame,
but a prisoner of Allah’s love. Therefore, after his victory, he didn’t go
to any palace to celebrate his success, but went out into the desert
to glorify Allah (swt). The Prophet had such a beautiful
voice that when he sang praises, the birds, the plants and even the 
mountains joined him to glorify Allah(swt)! Allah(swt) had chosen
Dawud(as) to be a prophet, and revealed the Psalms to him. When Dawud(as) recited the scriptures,
the mountains joined him, and the birds
danced around him!! And it was not just that, Allah(swt) had also blessed Dawud (as)  with the ability to understand the
 languages of animals and birds The young Prophet had the habit
of fasting every alternate day. And during the night, He used to sleep
for the first half of the night, and pray for sometime, and
again go back to sleep. Such was his devotion
to Allah(swt)! There were many wars during that time, and the Prophet was able to win 
every one of them for the People of Israel. The people praised
and loved Dawud(as) It was during this time that Talut
started getting jealous of the prophet. He despised the fact that people
praised the young man more than him.  He sensed something strange in the
 King’s attitude towards him. He asked his wife what was
 bothering her father His wife started
to weep, and said “O Dawud, I will never
keep any secrets from you. My father is jealous
of your popularity. He fears that he would
lose his kingdom to you” The prophet was
shocked to hear this. Then the wife told him that Talut
was planning something evil, and she asked her
husband to be on guard. The next day, Talut summoned
the prophet to his palace. “Caanan has gathered their army” He said “And they are
marching towards our kingdom” “You must take your
army, and fight them. Do not return unless
you are victorious” The prophet sensed that this was
an excuse to get rid of him. “Yes, I will take my army
and fight them” He replied. He knew that Caanan’s
army was big and strong. But even then, he
agreed to fight them Dawud (as) fought the
Caananites bravely. After a fierce battle that lasted for
many days, Allah(swt) granted them victory!! Talut had indeed hoped for Dawud(as) to get
 killed in the battle. He never expected the Prophet to defeat
 such a large army. When he saw the Prophet being adulated
by the Israelites, his fear increased. Talut called one of his trusted soldiers,
 and they made a plot to kill him that night itself. But Miqel overheard their plans,
 and she was terrified! She ran to her husband and asked
him to escape immediately. The Prophet gathered his belongings,
packed some food and set off on a camel. You see, when Talut became jealous
 of the Prophet,  he didn’t even bother to think about the
 well being of his daughter. Masha allah! That was
such a wonderful story! I really like the part where the prophet
killed Goliath with just a pebble! Now are you ready
for the questions? Yes! Alright.. now tell me the name of
the leader of the Philistine army I just told you that..
His name was Goliath! Now tell me how Dawud
(as) killed Goliath? The prophet killed
him by a sling shot Talut offered to marry his
daughter to whoever fought Goliath Her name was Miqel That’s right again! Why was Talut worried when the
Prophet started winning the battles?  Talut thought that the Prophet might
 snatch the kingdom away from him,  this made him jealous. Masha allah! You gave me all
the right answers my son. Its time for me to leave. I will tell you 
the remaining story tomorrow! Good night baba! Good night my son!"
" Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! Didn’t you say that you will tell me
the story of Prophet Ishmael (as) today? Yes my son,
 Insha Allah! I will tell you his story now. Shall I start? Yes Baba Bismillah! The story of Prophet Ishmael (as) A long long time ago, 
Prophet Ibrahim (as)  and his wife Sarah were travelling
 through a desert. They had been travelling for many days,
and one day, they happened to enter the
territory of an evil king. The evil king came to know about
the beautiful wife of the prophet, and he wanted to take her.  So he send one of his soldiers to bring the prophet to him. The soldier brought the prophet
before the king. “Who is the lady accompanying you?” asked the evil king The prophet replied that
 she was his sister. The evil king then asked the prophet
to bring Sarah to his court. He said that he wanted to meet
 this beautiful woman that everyone in his kingdom was
talking about. The prophet went to his wife and said
 “The king wants to meet you” “Do not ever tell him that you are
my wife, because I’ve told him that you are my sister” the prophet
 told his wife. When Sarah went to the King’s palace,
the king was struck by her beauty, and he tried to take hold of her
 with his hands! But the moment his hand 
got near Sarah, it became stiff,
and he could not move it!! The evil king was scared, and he requested Sarah “Please pray to Allah(swt) for me,
 and I will never harm you” When Sarah prayed to Allah(swt),
his hands got cured miraculously!! But the moment he realized that
 his hands were cured, the foolish king tried
to take hold of Sarah again!! And for the second time,
his hands got stiff. The king couldn’t move
 his hands at all!! “Please pray to Allah(swt)
for me.. I shall never harm you again!”
said the King Sarah prayed to Allah again,
 and his hands got cured for the second time. This time the King realized that
Sarah was no ordinary woman! So he gave Sarah a gift!  He gave her one of his 
Egyptian maid servant, and her name was Hajar! She was then sent home. When Sarah returned home, the prophet
asked her what happened? “Allah(swt) taught that evil king a lesson, and he gave me maid- Hajar” 
replied Sarah Years passed and the 
prophet grew old. His hair grayed, but he continued to
 call people back to Allah (swt). Sarah too had grown old and
 she realized that she would no longer be able to give
 birth to a child. So she asked the prophet to marry
 their servant Hajar. She then prayed to Allah(swt) to
 bless them with a child! After a few months,
Hajar gave birth to a child, and they named him 
Ishmael(as)! By now, the prophet had 
grown very old! One day the prophet woke up, he felt like Allah(swt) wanted
him to do something. So he went to Hajar. “Get Ishmael” 
He said  “Get  ready for a long journey” Ibrahim (as) and his wife with
 the baby in her arms kept travelling for a
 long long time. They walked for many days till they
 reached a dry valley of the desert  near the Al-Marwah mountain. There were no fruits, no trees, no food,
 and no water either No signs of any life could be
found in the valley. The Prophet then left his wife and son
with a small amount of food and water, This was hardly enough for both of them
 to last for two days. The Prophet then turned around
 and started walked away His wife hurried after him Where are you going leaving us in this barren valley? She cried to him But the prophet didn't answer her and kept walking away. She called him again But the prophet remained silent 
and walked away Finally she understood that the prophet
 was not acting on his own. She realized that Allah (swt) had 
commanded him to do this. Did Allah (swt) command to do so? She asked him The prophet shook his head
 and continued walking Then his great wife said, ""We are not going to be lost"" Since Allah(swt) who commanded 
you is with us The prophet was very sad,
 as he had left his wife and his son in a barrren desert, where there
 were no other people He prayed to Allah(swt) to give his wife 
and son enough food and he asked Allah(swt) to send people 
with good hearts to them Hajar (ra) drank the water
that the prophet had left, so that she could feed her son. The water got over very soon, and both of them started
getting very thirsty. After sometime, the baby
started getting thirsty, and started to cry! She ran to a hill closeby
called Al Marwah hoping that she might
find somebody. She stood there hoping to find
somebody, but she did not!! Then she ran to the next
mountain called Al Safa, hoping to find
someone from there! But she couldn’t find
anyone from there either! She kept running between
these mountains seven times! When she climbed Al
Marwah for the last time, she was very tired. She got so tired that she
sat next to her baby. It was then that
she heard a voice She kept quiet,and waited
to hear the voice again When she heard the voice
for the second time, she said “O, whoever
you might be, you have made me
hear your voice! Have you got something
to help me?” That was when she saw an
angel digging the earth! The angel kept digging till
the water flowed from it! It was a miracle! When she saw the water, she ran toward it, and started to build
a basin around it. She scooped the water with
her hands and drank from it. Then she filled the water bag
and ran towards her child. This place where the water
rose is called Zam Zam. After a few days, some people
were travelling through Mecca. They saw the birds
flying around Al Marwah, and they thought the birds might
be flying around the water. They started walking
towards Al Marwah When they arrived, they were surprised
to find the woman with a baby sitting
near the water! “Shall we stay here and
use this water please?” They asked her. Hajar(ra) said yes, and they drank water
from the Zam Zam Like that many others
came to Al Marwah, and eventually
settled down there. The whole valley
became alive now, and she and her child
were not alone anymore! Ismail (as) grew up and learned
Arabic from the people who had settled
downat Al Marwah. He was a good boy, and his virtues and qualities
made the people admire him. He kept thinking
about his father, and knew that his father
will come back someday! Ismail (as) then
married a local woman, and lived his life in peace. In the meantime, Prophet Ibrahim
(as) was very sad because he had not seen his
son for a very long time. One day, he decided to go to Mecca
to meet his wife and his son. He travelled for many days, and
finally arrived at Al Marwah But it was very late. When he arrived, people told him that Hajar(ra) had died sometime ago. The prophet was very
sad to hear this and then the local people told
the prophet that his son, Ismail (as) was still alive! The prophet was very
happy to hear this, and thanked Allah(swt)! When Ismail(as) saw his father, he ran to him and hugged
him very tightly. He could not believe his eyes!! He was very happy
to see his father after a long long time. It was a very happy
time for both of them But one day, Allah decided
to test Ibrahim(as) One night when the
prophet was sleeping, he saw a dream! In his dream the
prophet saw himself killing his son as a
sacrifice to Allah (swt). The prophet woke up, and ignored it as
it was just a dream But the next night, he saw the same dream again!. This time he realized that
this was not just a dream, and that Allah(swt) was asking
him to sacrifice his own son! The prophet went to his son, and told him about the dream. Ismail (as) realized that it
was an order from Allah(swt) ""Do what Allah(swt)
has asked you to” He told his father. The next day, the prophet took a
rope and a knife, and set out for mount
Arafat, along with his son. Upon reaching the top
of the mountain, Ismail (as) asked his father
to tie his hand and legs, so that he may not struggle
during the sacrifice. The prophet obliged, and
tied his hands and legs. Then he blindofolded himself so that he wont have to
watch his son suffer. The prophet raised his knife, but then suddenly, he heard
the voice from the sky. He took off his blindfold, and saw
a sheep being sent from heaven. Allah(swt) had sent the sheep to
be sacrified instead of Ismail(as) The prophet was really happy, because his son was
going to be alive! The prophet and his son had just passed a difficult
test from Allah (swt) Ibrahim (as)
slaughtered the sheep, and they had a big celebration. The prophet and his son kept calling
people to worship Allah(swt) They didn’t have any place
to worship Allah(swt) so one day Allah(swt) ordered
the prophet to build a house!! “Allah(swt) has ordered
me to build a Kabbah” the prophet said to his son. And Ismail(as) replied “Do what your God has
ordered you to do”. The prophet then asked his son if he help him build the kabbah, and Ismail (as) agreed. They started building the
foundation of the kabbah. Ismail (as) brought the stones, while Ibrahim (as)
built the house. When the walls got tall, Ismail(as) brought a large stone for the
 prophet to work by standing on it This stone was called
Maqam-e-Ibrahim. When they completed
the foundation, and built the corners, Ibrahim(as) asked Ismail(as) to
find the stone to fill the corner. “I feel tired” Ismail (as) said to his father. But when the
Ibrahim(as) insisted, Ismail(as) went searching
for the stone. While he was gone, an angel got the
prophet a stone. The angel told him that this stone was brought to
earth by Adam (as) from Paradise! The stone was originally white, however its color gradually
turned into black because of the sins committed
 by  people on earth. Ismail(as) returned
after sometime, and when he saw the stone he was surprised and asked his
father where it came from. “It was brought by someone who never
gets tired” replied Ibrahim(as) And they finally completed
building the Kabbah They prayed to Allah (swt)
to accept their work Allah(swt) was very happy with the prophet and his son
for spreading his message. And proclaimed the
pilgrimage among men, they will come to thee on foot, and on every kind of camel, lean an account of journeys through
deep and distant mountain highways. The prophet grew old, and so did his wife Sarah. One day when he was sitting
outside his house, he saw three men coming
towards his house. The three men were actually
angels sent by Allah (swt). The prophet welcome them
inside to have food. The strangers went in
and sat down for food. The Prophet served
them a roasted calf! But the strangers did not
touch the food at all. The prophet started to fear. Then the angels
comforted the prophet and asked him not
to fear at all. They told him that they were actually
the angels sent by Allah (swt). They informed him that
they came to his house to deliver a good news. They said that Allah (swt) was going to give them a son, and that he should
name him Ishaaq. They also told him that his
son would be a prophet. Sarah could not
believe her ears! How could that be true”
 she wondered. “I am so old” Then the angels said, all these things
are possible with Allah (swt). After a few months, Sarah got pregnant and
gave birth to a child! The prophet named
him Ishaaq(as), as the angels told him. After a few years, Prophet Ibrahim missed his
son Ismail (as) badly, so he went to see him. But when the prophet reached
the house of Ismail (as), he was not at home. His wife came out, and when the prophet asked
her about Ismail(as), she replied “He has gone in search
of livelihood”. He then asked her how was
their living conditions, to which she started
complaining about everything! She complained that they were
living in misery and hardship, and many other things. She was not at all grateful to
the blessings of Allah (swt) The prophet realized
that she was not at all a suitable wife for his son, so left her a message that
his son would understand. “When your husband returns convey my salutations to him” he said “and also tell him to change the
threshold of the gate”. The prophet then went
back to his home. When Ismail(as) returned
home in the evening, he felt something unusual “Did anyone visit us today?” he asked her. She replied, yes, and
passed on the message. When Ismail(as)
heard the message, he realized that
it was his father who visited him that day, and he understood the
message that he gave her. “It was my father, and he has advised
me to divorce you. You can go back to your family” He told her. His wife went back to her house, and Ismail (as) married
another woman. After a long time, Prophet Ibrahim (as) again
missed his son badly, so he visited his new
house once again. When he arrived, it was his new wife who
answered the door. The prophet asked
the same questions he had asked his former wife. But this time when she answered, the prophet realized that she was
a very grateful and kind woman. She kept thanking Allah(swt) for the wonderful
things going on around, and the prophet was very happy. “When your husband comes home, give him my regards” The prophet told Ismail’s wife. He also added “And also tell him that he should keep
the threshold of this gate firm”. He left after asking her to
deliver this secret message In the evening, when
Ismail (as)came back, he asked his wife if anyone
had come to visit him. When his wife told him about
the prophet and the message, Ismail (as) was very happy. “it was my father” 
said Ismail “and you are the
threshold of the gate. He asked me to keep
you with me forever” said the prophet happily!! Prophet Ibrahim (as) lived for One
hundred and seventy five years! He lived a life full of trials but he had a strong
faith in Allah (swt)!! The life of Prophet Ibrahim (as) teaches us to love Allah
(swt) unconditionally. Even though there are more than 
25 prophets mentioned in the Quran Allah mentions only two prophets ideal for whole humanity, and they were: Prophet
Muhammed (as), and Prophet Ibrahim (as) Masha Allah! That was such an amazing story! Hmm.. So you liked the
story of Ibrahim(as)? I loved it Baba! Ha haa.. Alright, now let me ask you
a few questions from the story. Shall I? Go ahead Tell me the names of the mountains
that Hajar (ra) ran across? Hmmm.. They were Al
Safa and Al Marwah That’s the right answer. Now tell me how the travelers
found the prophet's wife. I’ll give you three options. Option A) They saw animals
running towards the mountain. Option B) They saw water
flowing down the mountain. Option C) They saw birds
flying above the mountain It was option C! Hmm..! The travelers saw the
birds flying above the mountain! Haha..That’s right again! The next question. How did God test Ibrahim (as)? I know that one. God asked Ibrahim (as) to sacrifice
his only son Ismail (as) And did he sacrifice his son? No! Just before the sacrifice, God told the prophet
that he was testing him, and God send a sheep
instead for the sacrifice Masha Allah, that’s
the right answer. You are doing great my son. Thank you baba Why did the color of the stone that the angels brought
turn from white to black? Hmm.. It was because of the sins
commited by the people on earth. Excellent! And now for the last question, what was the name of the
second son of the prophet? It was Ishaaq (as)! Isn't that right baba? Yes my son, that’s
the right answer. That’s all for today. Insha Allah! I will tell you the
story of another prophet tomorrow Which story are you going
to tell me tomorrow? Insha Allah!I will tell you the story
of Prophet Ismail (as) tomorrow Thanks Baba! Good night! Good night!"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Wa Alaikum Assalam! Today, I’m going to tell you the story of
 Prophet Ibrahim (as). Are you ready? Yes! Prophet Ibrahim(as) plays a very
 important role in Islam. He fulfilled all the commandments and trials God gave him
 during his life.  As a result of his unwavering faith, He was promised by God to be a leader of all the
 nations in the world. Now lets start his story. Bismillah! The Story of Prophet Ibrahim (as) Prophet Ibraham (as) was born in 
the kingdom of Babylon  a long long time ago! He was blessed with wisdom even when he was a child, and this made him very very special! The Prophet was born during a time when the people 
worshipped the sun, the moon, the stars and 
they worshipped even the idols made out of stone! Ibrahim’s father was a sculptor,  and he used to make the idols
 with his own hands! His father never used to
 worship Allah(swt) at all! As a child, he used to sit and
 watch his father carving out these statues
 from stone. Ibrahim (as) got curious about these 
funny looking statues, and sometimes he used to
 play with them! But when he saw the same 
statue in temples, he got confused. He wondered why the people were prostrating
 before these stone idols, so he decided to ask his
 father about it. One day, when his father was carving
 a statue of Mardukh, the Prophet asked his father. “Baba, why are people worshipping
 these toys that you are making yourself?” “They represent our gods” 
His father replied. “We should worship them to 
get favours from Gods”. “Why does it have such big ears Baba?”  the Prophet asked “This statue is the god of gods,
 the Mardukh” He replied. The big ears represent his 
deep knowledge. Even though Ibrahim(as) was only seven 
years old at that time, he couldn’t control his laughter! As time went by, Ibrahim(as) grew with knowledge
 and wisdom. He knew that Allah(swt) was 
the only true God. His hatred for the idols increased
 as he grew older. Ibrahim(as) had now turned 
16 years old. Whenever he went to the temple 
along with his father, he was sad to see his people still
 praying to the idols. He saw that the people
were offering sacrifices  seeking forgiveness 
of their sins. One day Ibrahim(as), left his home in
search of Allah(swt), the true God. He walked for a very long time, and finally he reached a 
mountain nearby. He climbed the mountain, 
and sat near a cave nearby. He sat there for a very long time, and when he looked up, he saw a shining star! When he saw the beauty
 of the star, he wondered if this star
 could be Allah(swt). But after a while, the 
star disappeared! He realized that the star
 was not Allah(swt), as the true God will never 
set or disappear. After a while, the
 moon came up. The moon was very 
very beautiful, so Ibrahim(as) wondered if the
 moon could be Allah(swt). He sat there gazing at the 
moon for a long time, but after a few hours, when the moon disappeared
 from the horizon, he realized that the moon
 was not Allah(swt). Ibrahim(as) was disappointed, but he continued to sit there on the top of the mountain 
watching the horizon. It was early morning by now, and that was when the
 sun came up! He looked at the bright sun, and wondered again if this could be
Allah(swt) as it was bigger, and  very bright! But by evening, when the sun
 set in the horizon, he realized that it was not Allah(swt), as the true God would never set. It was then that Ibrahim(as) realized that the true god can 
never be created! He understood that Allah(swt) is the
 creator of everything even the sun, the moon 
and the stars! He then prostrated on the ground
 offering his thanks. He knew that Allah(swt) had just 
guided him to the truth! It was then that he realized 
that Allah(swt)  had chosen him to be a Prophet! God had chosen him to
 guide his people! It was going to be a new life
 for Prophet Ibrahim (as). He then travelled back home
 to tell his father about the great news. But when his father heard what 
he was saying, he got very very angry! ""How dare you reject my gods?” 
he asked angrily “O my father, 
follow me. I will guide you on the
 right path, Allah(swt) will punish you if you
don’t repent!” The Prophet pleaded 
with his father “I will ask people to stone you if you
 don’t stop speaking like this” His father shouted at him The Prophet was then asked to leave
 the house by his father. Ibrahim(as) was sad for his father, for he had turned him away. He realized he could do nothing more, so left home and
 walked away. He then went to the other people
 in his kingdom, to  guide them! He realized that it was his mission 
to call people back to Allah(swt)! Ibrahim(as) went to the market 
and shouted to them. “Allah(swt) is the one and 
only true God. There is no other God,
 but Allah(swt). There is nobody worthy of
 worship except him. I will not bow down to the
 idols anymore. The people at the market got really angry  when they heard him speak like this. “Why do you worship these idols” 
he asked them. “Don’t you realize that they
 have no power?” The people threatened 
him to go away, so Ibrahim(as) had to leave
 the market. But the Prophet thought of a plan to show them that the idols 
were not real Gods. One day there was a big celebration
 near the river bank, and the Prophet knew that
 everyone in the city would be present there. The Prophet waited  till he was sure that there was
 nobody left in the town. He then took an axe, and went inside the temple. There were many idols kept
 inside the temple, and the Prophet started smashing 
the idols with his Axe!! One by one, he smashed
 all the idols, except for one, that was the biggest idol
 inside the temple.  He hung the axe around the 
neck of this statue, and left the temple. The next day, when the people of the town came 
to the temple to worship, they were shocked to see the idols 
smashed into pieces! The pieces were lying around,
 all over the place. They gathered together
 and discussed who could have done
 this terrible act. “There was a young man at
 the market yesterday” one of them said. “He was speaking 
against our gods” “I know this person- His name was Ibrahim”
said the other The people found Prophet Ibrahim(as), and brought him
 to the temple. “Are you the one who has done 
these to our Gods?” They asked him ""It was the statue here, 
yes that big one” the Prophet replied. “Why don’t you ask him, he will tell you if he can speak” This angered the people further. “You know very well that these
 idols do not speak.” Then Prophet Ibrahim(as) said “Then why do you worship these 
idols who cannot speak,  nor do they see or hear. Have you lost your minds?” The people were ashamed and 
looked around, and saw the shattered pieces of
 idols lying everywhere. Some of them realized that Ibrahim(as) 
was saying the truth. But the others were still 
very angry with him “Punish him” they shouted. They wanted to take revenge
 for shattering the idols! They tied him in chains, and gathered around to discuss how they were going to punish
 the Prophet. “Lets burn him in fire” one of them said. “Lets build the biggest fire anyone 
has ever seen, and throw him into it. Everyone thought it was a great idea. The people of Babylon then started
 building a fire so large that even the birds could
 not fly above it. It was so hot that the people
 couldn’t go near it Masha Allah! That was such a great story! Hahaa.. That’s all for today, I’ll tell rest of the
 story tomorrow. Ok Baba Shall I ask you a few questions 
from the story? Yes! Where was Prophet Ibrahim (as) born? Babylon! He was born
 in Babylon! Masha Allah! That's the 
right answer. Now tell me what did the 
Prophet's father do? I’ll give you some options. Option A- Carpenter, Option B- Sculptor, Option C- Wood Cutter This one was so easy!  It was Option B,  He was a sculptor! Hmm.. Right again! Now for the next question, Tell me why was the Prophet asked
 to leave from the house? The Prophet refused to 
worship the idols, and this made his father 
very angry. That’s why his father asked him
 to leave the house. Isn't that right Baba? That’s correct my son! Why were the people of Babylon
 angry at the Prophet? The Prophet wanted to teach the
 people of Babylon a lesson, so he smashed all the idols
 they worshipped. Masha Allah,  that’s the
 right answer! That’s all for today, I will tell you the remaining
 story tomorrow. Good night Good night!"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Waalaikum Assalam! Its story time again! So excited ? Yes Baba,  I really want to hear the story of
 Prophet Ishaq (as) today Hmm.. Not much is known about
Prophet Ishaq (as), so I will tell you all the known facts
 about this prophet, and I will also tell you the story
of Prophet Yaqub (as),  who was his son Are you going to tell me the story
of two prophets today?  Alright Alright, now sit down
and listen carefully Bismillah! The Story of Prophet Ishaq (as)
and Yaqub (as) Prophet Ibrahim (as) grew old, and so did his wife Sarah. One day when he was sitting
outside his house,  he saw three men coming
 towards his house. The three men were actually angels
 sent by Allah (swt). The prophet welcomed them
inside to have food. The strangers went in and
sat down for food. Prophet served them a roasted calf! But the strangers did not touch
the food at all. The prophet started to fear. Then the angels comforted the
prophet and asked him not to fear at all. They told him that they were actually the
 angels sent by Allah (swt). They informed him that they
 came to his house  to deliver a good news. They said that Allah (swt) was going to
 give them a son, and that he should name him Ishaaq. They also told him that his son
would be a prophet. Sarah could not believe her ears! “How could that be true”
 she wondered. “I am so old” Then the angels said that all things are
possible with Allah (swt). After a few months, Sarah got pregnant and gave
 birth to a child! The prophet named him Ishaaq,
 as the angels told him. Ishaq (as) grew up as an obedient boy. He worked hard, and like the angels foretold, he too became of prophet
 of Allah (swt). Ibrahim (as) was very old by the
time Ishaq(as) grew up. As he felt that his life was
 nearing its end, he wished to see his
 son get married. But he did not want Ishaq(as) to marry
 one of the Caananites,  as they were all disbelievers One day, he sent one of his trustworthy
 servants to Haran  to choose a bride of Ishaq(as) The servant obeyed his master and
travelled for many days to reach Haran Once he reached Haran,  the servant selected Rebekkah,  the daughter of Ibn Nahor, who was a brother of
 Prophet Ibrahim (as). And as his father wished, Ishaq(as)
married Rebekkah Rebekkah didn’t give brith to a
child for a long time. Ishaq (as) kept praying to
 Allah (swt) for a child, and after many years,  she gave brith to twins!  Ishaq(as) named them
Esau and Yaqub! Esau grew upto be a strong man,  and he was a good hunter. But Yaqub was more intelligent  and he was his father’s favourite. There were frequent fights
between the brothers as Esau disliked the fact that his father
favoured Yaqub(as) more than him. Esau became more and more jealous
 as they grew! Ishaq(as) grew old, and he
 could not see clearly. One day he asked Esau to go hunting  and bring him some cooked meat. Rebekkah, his wife,  overheard the conversation and
 she ran to her son Yaqub(as)! Esau agreed and went
 hunting for the meat “Slaughter two goats of your best flock”
she said to him “and cook them as you know
 your father will like. Go and do this before your
 brother returns” Yaqub(as) did as his mother had ordered. Rebekkah then asked him to put on
 his brothers clothes, and then she covered his hands and
 neck with goat's skin!  This was to make his skin feel like Esau, who was very hairy. Then Yaqub stepped into
 his father's room. “Who are you”
 asked Ishaq (as) “I am your son” replied Yaqub(as)
 in a deep voice. His father then started eating the food. Once he finished his food, he blessed Yaqub(as) to be
the better brother and to be the leader of
 of his people! Once he got the blessings,
 he left the room. Esau returned with the
 meat after sometime, and he entered his father's room. “What is this my son?” The prophet asked when he heard
Esau’s footsteps. “I’ve brought you the meat you like” Ishaq(as) was now confused. Didn’t you bring me the
food an hour ago?” He asked him “I also gave you my blessings”. “No.. I swear I did not”
 Esau said. He then knew that he had been
cheated by Yaqub(as)! He felt so angry that he wanted to
 kill Yaqub right away! Rebekkah saw what had happened So she went to Yaqub(as) and ordered him
to go to her brother Laban  in the land of Haran. She asked him to stay there until his
 brother was not angry at him anymore!. Yaqub (as) left his family and started his
journey towards Haran. He travelled for many days
 in the desert. One evening, he got very tired of walking
and decided to get some rest. He took a stone and put it under
 his head, and slept. That was when he had an
 amazing dream! In his dream, he saw a ladder from
 heaven to earth! He saw that the angels
were coming down  and going up the ladder. It was then that Allah (swt)
 blessed Yaqub(as) and this piece of land for his
future generations. When he woke up, he exploded with Joy!. He took a vow that if he returned
 to his family safely, he would build a mosque
 here for Allah (swt). He also vowed to give one tenth
of his property to Allah (swt) He poured oil on that stone
 so that he would be  able to recognize this place later. This place is today known by the
 name of Jerusalem! The next morning, Yaqub(as)
 set out for Haran After many days of travelling, he finally reached Haran. Yaqub (as) then met his
maternal uncle Laban. His uncle was very happy to see him,  and invited him to his house. Laban had two daughters-
Leah and Rachel. The prophet started working
hard for Laban. During his stay,  he fell in love with his uncle’s younger
daughter Rachel After a few months, he asked Laban to marry Rachel. “Work for me for seven years”
 he said “and I will let you marry
my daughter”. The prophet agreed to his terms. Yaqub (as) worked hard and
Laban prospered. After the end of the
seventh year, his uncle prepared a feast and
 gathered people for the wedding. But his uncle tricked him, and he got his elder
daughter Leah married to Yaqub (as). Leah was weak sighted and ugly. Yaqub(as) didn’t know about this,  and he discovered the truth
 only in the morning!! When he realized that he
 had been tricked,  he went to his uncle “You deceived me.” He said to Laban. “I was engaged to Rachel, and you married me to Leah?” His uncle said “it is not our tradition to marry
the younger daughter before the elder one. “However”
 he added “If you love Rachel, work for another seven years and
 I will let you marry her” Yaqub (as) worked hard for
another seven years and then married Rachel. It was acceptable in their time, as described in Torah, for a man to marry two sisters. Laban gave a female slave
to each daughter. Leah’s slave was called Zilpah, and Rachel’s slave was
 called Bilha. What happened then? I will tell you the remaining
story tomorrow. Oh no! Please tell me now Baba!
 Please please Come on.. It’s time for
 you to go to sleep. I will ask you a few questions now, and I’ll tell you rest of the
story tomorrow Alright Baba Are you ready for the question? Yes! Why did the three angels come to the
 house of Prophet Ibrahim (as)? They came to deliver the news that
 they were going to have a son! Masha Allah! That’s the
 correct answer What was the name of the wife
of Prophet Ishaq(as)? I know that..
 It was Rebekkah! That’s right again! What were the names of
 Prophet Ishaq’s sons? It was Esau… and..and..Yaqub! That’s right again! Now tell me why Esau
 hated Yaqub (as)? Esau hated him because he was
 his fathers favourite son, and also that God chose him
 as the next prophet That’s correct What was the name of Yaqub’s
 uncle in Haran?  Wasn’t it Laban? That’s correct again! How long did Yaqub work for Laban? First he worked for seven years, and then he worked for
 another seven years Its 14, the prophet worked
for 14 years for Laban What were the names of the
daughters of Laban?  They were Leah and Rachel! Masha Allah, you gave all the
 right answers. That’s all for today, I will tell you the story of another
 prophet tomorrow. Assalamu Alaikum Walaikum Assalam Did you finish your homework today? Yes Baba, I did! So are you ready for the story of another prophet? I am always ready for the stories of prophet! Oh, is that so? Insha Allah, I willtell you the story of Prophet
Lut (as) today Bismillah! Prophet Ibrahim (as) left the city of Babylon along with his nephew Lut (as)
and Sarah. They travelled for many days
in the desert Prophet Lut then
decided to go to the city of Sodom, which was on the western
shore of the Dead Sea This city was filled
with evil people. The people of the town were very wicked, and they attacked the travelers
passing by. Another common evil among the people of Sodom, was that the men had
sex with men, instead of women they were all gay people! No one had committed such sins ever before. This unnatural sin
was later known as Sodomy, after
the city of Sodom. The people committed
this sin without any shame in front of everyone. It was during the heights of crimes and sins that Allah (swt)
sent his messenger Prophet Lut (as) to call the people back to him! The prophet summoned the people to give up their indecent behavior, but they were sunk way too deep in their sins that they were deaf to Prophets preaching. Lut then warned them of
Allah’s punishment. But they then threatened to drive him out of the city, if he kept on preaching! The prophet was saddened when they continued
their way of life. The news of the
evil men in Sodom spread throughout the land. The prophet continued with his struggle to correct their ways. Years passed, and the prophet continued with his mission. No one responded to his call, except for the members
of his family. And even in his family, not everyone listened to his words, and this included
one of his wife! With very few people to
believe in him, the prophet was tormented both inside and
outside his home! His life was a
continuous torture, and he suffered greatly, but the prophet remained patient and steadfast with his people. Years went by, but no one was willing
to listen to Him. They even mocked
at him by saying “If what you are saying is true, then bring Allah’s
punishment to us.” When the people refused
to listen to him even after so many years, the prophet finally
lost hope in them. And that’s when Allah decided to send the angels to destroy the evil
people in Sodom. The angels took human form, and went to the house
of Ibrahim (as). Prophet Ibrahim and his wife Sarah were very old by now. He invited the angels to have food at his home, and the angels agreed. The prophet served
roasted calf to the angels, but they didn’t touch
the food at all! When Ibrahim noticed
that they were not even touching the food, he started to worry, and he started fear them. The visitors then informed the prophet that they were actually angels
sent by Allah (swt). They told him that Sarah will
get pregnant soon, and that she will give
birth to a child! The prophet and his wife were delighted to hear this news! The angels told the prophet that they should name
their son Ishaaq, and that he would grow up to become a prophet as well. The angels then walked toward the city of Sodom. They reached the walls of the town in the afternoon. They then started walking toward the river. The first person who caught the sight of the angels  was Lut’s daughter. She was sitting beside the river filling water in her jug. When she lifted her face and saw them, she was stunned! Never before had she seen such beautiful men in
her whole life!! She couldn’t believe that such beauty even existed on earth! “Is there any place to rest?” asked one of the angels. “Stay here” she replied. She knew that if the evil men in her town saw them, they would try to
harm these strangers. “Do not enter until
I inform my father” She told them. She then left her jug
beside the river and ran quickly to
inform her father. “Oh father” she cried. There are three young and attractive men at the town gate. I have never seen such beautiful faces before” The prophet got worried, and he ran to the town gate. The prophet did not
recognize that they were actually angels as he thought they were
travelers passing by. “Where did you come from”
the prophet asked them “And where are you going?” But they did not answer
his question. Instead, they asked if they could stay at his house. Lut was in a dilemma now. He wanted to tell
these strangers not to stay because of the evil people in the city, without offending them. Yet at the same time, he wanted to extend
the hospitality shown to the guests. He tried several times
to convince them, but they insisted on
staying in the city. At last, he told them to wait outside the town
gate till night, so that no one who
would see them. When it became dark, Lut went to the
gates and escorted the strangers to his home. As the prophet had planned, no one saw them. When they reached his house, the prophets wife saw them, and she slipped out
of the house quietly. No one noticed her
leaving the house. She ran to to her people and informed them about the beautiful strangers
at her house. The news of the strangers spread like wildfire Everyone rushed to Lut’s house to see the strangers! Lut was surprised when he saw the people coming
towards his house. He wondered how they got the news of the strangers. And when he noticed that his wife was missing, he realized that it was she who informed the people. The prophet was very sad that she cheated on them. When Lut saw the mob approaching his house, he immediately shut the door. He pleaded with them to leave the strangers alone, He warned them of
Allah’s punishment. The evil people of Sodom roared with laughter when they heard the
Prophet’s words, and they broke down the door! Lut tried to defend his guests, but he stood powerless these violent people. He wished that he had the power to save his guests. When the angels saw the prophet in a state of despair, they revealed themselves to the prophet! “Do not be frightened! We are the angels, and these people will not harm you!” they said to the prophet. When the mob heard the angels, they fled from the prophet’s house terrified! They abused the prophet and
ran to their homes. The angels then asked Lut to leave the town before sunrise. They asked him to take with him everyone, except the wife who
cheated on him. Lut (as) left the
city at dawn liked the angels asked him to. He took with him two
of his daughters who were the only believers. When the morning
came, Allah (swt) started the destruction
of the most corrupted city on earth! At first he sent the earthquake that rocked the city down! It was as if a mighty
power had lifted the entire city and flung
it down in one jolt. And then he sent a
storm of stones, that rained on the city! Everyone in the
city was destroyed including the prophet’s wife. The town of Sodom
was erased from the face of the earth, and no one survived except the prophet and his daughters! Lut (as) then went to see
his uncle Ibrahim (as). He visited them and told him what happened in Sodom. But Ibrahim (as)
already knew what had happened as the angels had informed him beforehand. Lut (as) continued
to invite people to Allah, and so did Abraham (as) for a long long time. That was such an
amazing story baba! Mashallah, I’m
glad you liked it. I have a doubt. Go on.. ask me How was prophet Ibrahim (as) and Lut (as) related? Prophet Lut (as) was the nephew of Prophet Ibrahim (as) Oh.. Now I remember! Thank you! Alright.. Now are you ready for the questions? I am ready! Ok, not tell me It was Sodomy! That’s the right
answer, very good! Now for the next question. Who were the three strangers to visit the land of Sodom? They were the angels! Mashallah, that was so quick.
Alright, now for the next question. When the angels
arrived at the town gate, who was the
first to see them? The angels were first seen by Prophet’s daughter! That’s right again! Why didn’t the prophet invite the strangers to his
house right away? Why did he ask them
to wait till night The strangers were
very beautiful, and the prophet knew that if the evil people
of Sodom saw them, they would hurt these strangers. That’s why he asked them to stay there till night Mashallah! That’s
impressive Amir That’s brilliant my son.
Now that’s all for today, I will tell you the story of another prophet tomorrow.."
"Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum As-salam Baba! Are you ready for today’s story? Yes! That’s great! Inshallah, I’m goint to tell you the
story of Prophet Musa(as) today! Who was he Baba? Prophet Musa (as) is
considered a Prophet, Messenger, and a
Leader in Islam. He is the most frequently mention
individual in the Quran. The Quran states that the Prophet was
sent by God to the Pharaoh of Egypt and the Israelites for
guidance and warning Wow! Please tell me the story! Alright, now listen carefully Bismillah! The Story of Prophet Musa (as) Prophet Musa (as)
grew up as a Prince! The Pharaoh’s who ruled over Egypt  were very cruel towards the
 descendants of Yaqub (as). The descendants were known
as the children of Israel. They were kept as slaves and
forced to work for small wages, and sometimes even for nothing! The Pharaoh wanted the
Israelites to obey only him, and worship only his Gods! This way many dynasties came to Egypt,
and they assumed that they were Gods, or their representative
spokesmen. Years passed, and a very cruel man
named Phir’oun was the Pharaoh now. He hated the Israelites very much. He punished the Israelites
at every given opportunity. He hated to see them multiplying
and prospering in his kingdom. One night when the Pharaoh was sleeping,
he had a dream! In his dream, he saw that a huge ball
 of fire came from the sky, and burned down the city. The fire burned the
houses of all Egyptians, but the houses of
Israelites stayed unharmed! The Pharaoh was horrified! He didn’t understand
what the dream meant, so the next day… he called his priests
and magicians. He asked them about
the dream he had. The priests said to him “This means that a boy will be
born to the Israelites very soon. Egyptians are going to perish
at the hands of this boy!” The Pharaoh got very angry! He ordered to kill every male
child born to the Israelites! Pharaoh’s order was carried out, and the soldiers began to kill every
male child born to the Israelites! It was during at that time that
Prophet Musa (as) was born.  The Prophet was born to a poor]
 Israelite family, and he had an elder brother
named Haroon (as), and another sister. Allah (swt) had a
plan for the Prophet. He ordered his mother to
place him in a basket, and allow it to float downstream
in the great Nile river! Musa (as)’s mother did as she
was told, and as she let him float in the river. Her heart grieved for her son! However, she was aware that
Allah(swt) cared for her son, and she knew that no
harm will come to him. As the basket floated away, she asked her daughter to follow the
 basket downstream, and make sure that no harm
came to her son. The basket floated in the
river for a long time, and the Prophet’s sister followed the
basket as her mother had instructed. Allah(swt) was guiding the basket, and after floating on
river Nile for sometime, the basket entered
a small stream The Pharaoh’s wife was
bathing in that stream, and when she saw the basket, she asked her servants
to bring it ashore. When she saw the baby, she just fell in love with him. Pharaoh’s wife was very
different from the Pharaoh. She was a believer, and she was also merciful. She was longing for a child, so when she saw the baby, she hugged and kissed him. Pharaoh was surprised when he saw his
wife hugging and kissing the baby. He was astonished as he saw her weeping
with joy, which he had never seen before! “Let me keep this baby, and
let him be a son to us” she requested her husband. The Pharaoh couldn’t refuse her, and they decided
to adopt the baby. After sometime, the baby
started getting hungry and he started crying The queen summoned a few wet nurses
to feed the baby, but he refused to take any of
 their breast milk. It was then that the soldiers
brought the sister to the queen “This girl was following
the basket” they told her Then the sister replied “I was just following the basket
out of curiosity, your highness” When she saw her brother crying, she was worried and
she blurted out “I know someone
who can feed him” The queen agreed, and she ordered
the soldiers to fetch the woman, that the little girl
was talking about. The prophet’s sister then
brought their mother, and she started to feed him. As the child was
put to her breast, he immediately started
suckling the milk. The Pharaoh, who was watching all this,
was astonished,  and asked “Who are you? This child has refused to take
any other breast, but yours?” The mother of the Prophet knew
that if she told them the truth, they would kill
them immediately. So she told them “I am a woman
of sweet milk, and sweet smell. That’s why no child refuses me” Her answer satisfied
the Pharaoh, and she was appointed
as his nurse. Musa (as) grew up in the
palace as a prince. Allah(swt) granted him good health,
strength, knowledge and wisdom! He had a kind heart, so the weak and the
oppressed often turned to him seeking help One day, while he was
walking in the city, he saw an Egyptian soldier
beating an Israelite. When the Israelite
saw the Prophet, he begged him for his help. The Prophet decided
to help the poor man, and asked the soldier to
stop beating the Israelite. The soldier questioned
his authority, and said something that
really angered the Prophet. The Prophet first tried to
reason with the soldier, but he was not
willing to listen. Then the Prophet stepped forward and hit
the soldier with such a powerful blow, that he collapsed and died! When he realized
what he had done, a cold sweat broke out
from his forehead He said to himself “This is the evil work of Shaitan. He misled me” The Prophet knew that it
was a sin to kill anyone until he is brought to
trial and found guilty. He knelt on the ground
and prayed to Allah(swt) “O my Lord! I I have
indeed wronged my soul. Please forgive me” The next day he saw the same
Israelite fighting with another man. The Prophet helped the
weaker one, and said “You seem to be involved in fights
everyday with one or the other” The Israelite got
scared and said “I’m so sorry. Please don’t kill me like
how your killed the soldier yesterday” The Egyptian with whom the Israelite was
fighting, overheard the remarks, and he reported this
to the authorities. The next day, when Musa (as)
was walking in the city, a man came running to him “Musa! The soldiers are
coming to arrest you! Get away while there is
still time!” said the man The Prophet knew that the penalty
for killing an Egyptian was death. So he decided to leave Egypt. The Prophet left Egypt in a hurry, so he didn’t even bother to change
 his clothes.  He was not prepared for travelling , so he didn’t have
an animal to ride, nor did he have a caravan. He had left as soon
as the man warned him Mashallah! That was
such a wonderful story! I’m glad you like it my son! Yes, I am! Alright. Now tell me why did the Pharaoh order to kill every male child
 born to the Israelites? Hmm.. He did so because
his priests warned him. They told him that a child would be
born to the Israelites, and that all Egyptians would perish at
 the hands of the boy! Mashallah! That was right Now tell me how the
Prophet’s mother saved him? Allah(swt) commanded her to place
her baby in a basket, and let the basket
float on river nile! And can you tell me
who found the basket The Queen found the basket, and
she adopted the boy as her son! That’s great! Now tell me why
the Prophet had to leave Egypt The Prophet while trying
to save an Israelite, killed an Egyptian soldier. When the authorities came to arrest
him, the Prophet left the country That was brilliant!! Now that’s all for today, I will
tell you another story tomorrow Good night my son!"
"(----No dialogue, background sound only---) Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! Come on son, Let us go take a walk outside That sounds great! Wait for a second Baba,
  I’m coming (----No dialogue,background sound only---) It’s a beautiful day, isn’t it? Yes Baba, It is! What is the book that you
are carrying with you? Oh! I have my favourite parts of all
the Prophet Stories written in it! My friends love these
stories at school! Masha Allah!
That’s wonderful! You are such a good son! Thanks Baba! So do you remember the story
that I told you yesterday? Of course Baba, I remember The Prophet’s encounter with an angel, and the way it changed his life! Insha Allah,  I will tell you the remaining story of
Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) Now listen carefully (---No dialogue--- ) Bismillah! (----No dialogue, Background sound only---) The Story of Prophet
Muhammad (pbuh) (----No dialogue---) In the last episode we saw how the Prophet had converted
the people close to Him, into Islam (----No dialogue---) For three long years, the Prophet labored quietly to
deliver the message of God. (----No audio---- ) Idol worship was deeply rooted
 among the people,  and the Prophet tried to convince
 as much as He could (----No dialogue---) After three years of struggle, He was only able to
secure thirty followers! (----No dialogue---) Even His companions had now
started questioning His sanity! (----No dialogue---) By now His enemies had started
plotting against the Prophet The Prophet preached that everyone
were equal in front of God, and this challenged the
authority of local priests! (----No dialogue---) One day, they gathered together and decided
to suppress the movement of Prophet. They decided that each family
should take upon themselves the task of stamping out
the followers of Islam. Each household started torturing
 its own members, relatives and slaves who were
following the Prophet. The people were beaten, flogged
and then thrown into the prison The hill of Ramada and the
 place called Bata had now become scenes of cruel torture. Only the Prophet was left out, because He had the protection of
Abu Talib and Abu Bakr (---No audio---) Then the priests tried to tempt the
Prophet into joining their religion. For this, they sent Utba Ibn
Rabi’a to meet the Prophet “O son of my brother”
said the messenger “You are distinguished
by your qualities. Yet, you have
denounced our Gods. I am here to make a
proposition to you” “I am listening to you, O son
of Walid” said the Prophet. “If you are willing to acquire riches,
 honors, dignity, then we are willing to offer you a fortune
larger than what we have among ourselves. We shall make you our chief,  and we will consult everything with you. If you desire dominion, then we shall make you our king”
 said Utba When Utba had finished, the Prophet said “Now listen to me of father of Walid” (----No audio----) “I’m listening”
replied Utba The Prophet recited the first
thirteen verses of Surah Fussilat (----No audio----) He praised Allah (swt), and explained  about the glad
tidings of paradise to anyone who believed in the one true god. (----No audio----) The Prophet then reminded him about what had
happened to the people of ‘Ad and Thamud When the Prophet had
finished His recitation, he said to Utba “This is my reply to
your proposition. Now take what course
you find the best” (----No audio---) When their plan to tempt
the Prophet failed, (----No audio---) they approached His
uncle- Abu Talib The Prophet’s uncle tried persuading the
Prophet to stop preaching to the people  But the Prophet said “O uncle!  I f they were to put the sun in
my right hand,  and the moon in my left hand to stop me
from preaching Islam,  I would never stop!” The Prophet, overcome by the thought that
 His uncle was willing to desert Him,  turned to depart from His home. But Abu Talib called out
to the Prophet loudly. He asked Him to come back. When the Prophet came back, Abu Talib told Him  “Say whatever you please. By the Lord, I shall not
desert you forever! The Priests from different tribes started publicly
prosecuting the supporters of the Prophet. (----No dialogue----) It was during this time that a Christian
king named Al Najashi was ruling Abyssinia. The prophet had heard about
 the righteousness, tolerance and hospitality of
 this kind ruler. When the persecution became
 unbearable for the people, the Prophet advised them to
 emigrate to Abyssinia. Some 15 families emigrated to this country,
in small groups to avoid detection. This is called the first Hijrah in the
 history of Islam.  This happened during the fifth year
of the Prophet’s mission. (----No dialogue----) The emigrants received a kind reception
from the king and his people. They were soon followed by many others, who suffered at the hands of the
evil Priests in Makkah.  The number of people who emigrated
soon reached around 100. When the priests heard about
this, they were furious! They decided not to leave the
 emigrants in peace. They immediately sent two
 envoys to the King, for bringing back all of them. (----No dialogue---) When the envoys met the King, He summoned the poor fugitives and asked them what they had to say (---No audio---) Ja’far the son of Abu Talib, and brother
of Ali then spoke for the exiles “O king!  We were plunged in the
 depth of barbarism, we adored idols,  we disregarded everything,  and we had no law. Then Allah raised a man among
us, who was pure and honest. He taught us to worship Allah(swt), and forbade us from
worshipping the idols. He taught us to speak the truth, and to be faithful. We believe in Him, and we have
 accepted His teachings. His followers were persecuted, forcing us back into worship
the idols again! When we found no
safety in among them, we came to your kingdom trusting
us to save us from them. (----No audio---) When the King heard his speech, He asked the envoy to return to their land, and not to interfere
with the emigrants. (----No dialogue----) While His followers sought
refuge in foreign lands,  the Prophet continued his preaching
against strict opposition. Some of them mocked at Him,
and they asked for a sign. Then the Prophet would say “Allah(swt) has not sent me
to work wonders, He has sent me to preach to you” (----No dialogue---) But the Priests persistent
didn’t agree with Him. They insisted that unless they saw sign, they would not believe in His Lord. The disbelievers used to ask “Why is He not showing any miracles
like the previous Prophets?” “Because miracles had proved inadequate
to convince” answered the prophet. “Noah was sent with signs,  then what happened? Where was the lost tribe of Thamud? They refused to believe in Prophet
Salih, unless they showed a sign. Then the Prophet caused the rocks to
break and brought forth a living camel. He did what they asked for. Then what happened? In anger, the people cut the camel’s feet and again dared
 the Prophet to fulfill his threat of judgement.  Eventually they all lay dead in their
 beds the next morning. (---No dialogue---) There are some seventeen
places in Quran, in which the Prophet is challenged
 to show a sign.  But He gave all of them the same answer (---No audio---) After sometime, the priests
approached Abu Talib again, and asked him to
abandon his nephew. But the honorable man declared his intention
to protect the Prophet against any harm. (----No dialogue----) Masha Allah, That was such an amazing story! I’m glad you liked it Amir! (----No dialogue---) What happened to the Prophet? Did the priests harm Him? (----No dialogue---) (----Baba laughing----) I will tell you about
that tomorrow Amir! (----No dialogue---) I am so excited Baba! (----No dialogue---) I’m sure you are. So are you ready
for the questions? Yes Baba! I am! Alright. Now tell me how many followers did the
Prophet gain after three years of preaching? Hmm..The Prophet gained only
about thirty followers! (---No dialogue---) That’s correct Amir! How did the Priests of other
tribe try to tempt the Prophet? They first offered to give Prophet
 loads of wealth. When the Prophet refused, they then offered to appoint Him as their leader And what did the Prophet do? The Prophet then recited the
first thirteen verses of Surah (---No dialogue---) Masha Allah, that was the right answer Amir. What did they do next? They then approached Abu Talib,  the Prophet’s
uncle, and asked Him to stop his nephew. And what did Abu Talib do? He approached the Prophet and
requested Him to stop the preaching. But the Prophet refused
His uncle as well That’s wonderful! Can you tell me
what happened next? The disbelievers then started
persecuting the supporters of Prophet. That’s correct again. Now tell me the name of the
Christian King who ruled Abyssinia? Hmm..His name was Al Najashi,
and He was a wise ruler Masha Allah! That was correct again! That’s all for today son I will tell
you the remaining story tomorrow. Come, lets go back home Yes Baba! (------No dialogue----)"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Wa Alaikum Assalam! Today, I’m going to tell you the story of
 Prophet Ibrahim (as). Are you ready? Yes! Prophet Ibrahim(as) plays a very
 important role in Islam. He fulfilled all the commandments and trials God gave him
 during his life.  As a result of his unwavering faith, He was promised by God to be a leader of all the
 nations in the world. Now lets start his story. Bismillah! The Story of Prophet Ibrahim (as) Prophet Ibraham (as) was born in
the kingdom of Babylon  a long long time ago! He was blessed with wisdom even when he was a child, and this made him very very special! The Prophet was born during a time when the people
worshipped the sun, the moon, the stars and
they worshipped even the idols made out of stone! Ibrahim’s father was a sculptor,  and he used to make the idols
 with his own hands! His father never used to
 worship Allah(swt) at all! As a child, he used to sit and
 watch his father carving out these statues
 from stone. Ibrahim (as) got curious about these
funny looking statues, and sometimes he used to
 play with them! But when he saw the same
statue in temples, he got confused. He wondered why the people were prostrating
 before these stone idols, so he decided to ask his
 father about it. One day, when his father was carving
 a statue of Mardukh, the Prophet asked his father. “Baba, why are people worshipping
 these toys that you are making yourself?” “They represent our gods”
His father replied. “We should worship them to
get favours from Gods”. “Why does it have such big ears Baba?”  the Prophet asked “This statue is the god of gods,
 the Mardukh” He replied. The big ears represent his
deep knowledge. Even though Ibrahim(as) was only seven
years old at that time, he couldn’t control his laughter! As time went by, Ibrahim(as) grew with knowledge
 and wisdom. He knew that Allah(swt) was
the only true God. His hatred for the idols increased
 as he grew older. Ibrahim(as) had now turned
16 years old. Whenever he went to the temple
along with his father, he was sad to see his people still
 praying to the idols. He saw that the people
were offering sacrifices  seeking forgiveness
of their sins. One day Ibrahim(as), left his home in
search of Allah(swt), the true God. He walked for a very long time, and finally he reached a
mountain nearby. He climbed the mountain,
and sat near a cave nearby. He sat there for a very long time, and when he looked up, he saw a shining star! When he saw the beauty
 of the star, he wondered if this star
 could be Allah(swt). But after a while, the
star disappeared! He realized that the star
 was not Allah(swt), as the true God will never
set or disappear. After a while, the
 moon came up. The moon was very
very beautiful, so Ibrahim(as) wondered if the
 moon could be Allah(swt). He sat there gazing at the
moon for a long time, but after a few hours, when the moon disappeared
 from the horizon, he realized that the moon
 was not Allah(swt). Ibrahim(as) was disappointed, but he continued to sit there on the top of the mountain
watching the horizon. It was early morning by now, and that was when the
 sun came up! He looked at the bright sun, and wondered again if this could be
Allah(swt) as it was bigger, and  very bright! But by evening, when the sun
 set in the horizon, he realized that it was not Allah(swt), as the true God would never set. It was then that Ibrahim(as) realized that the true god can
never be created! He understood that Allah(swt) is the
 creator of everything even the sun, the moon
and the stars! He then prostrated on the ground
 offering his thanks. He knew that Allah(swt) had just
guided him to the truth! It was then that he realized
that Allah(swt)  had chosen him to be a Prophet! God had chosen him to
 guide his people! It was going to be a new life
 for Prophet Ibrahim (as). He then travelled back home
 to tell his father about the great news. But when his father heard what
he was saying, he got very very angry! ""How dare you reject my gods?”
he asked angrily “O my father,
follow me. I will guide you on the
 right path, Allah(swt) will punish you if you
don’t repent!” The Prophet pleaded
with his father “I will ask people to stone you if you
 don’t stop speaking like this” His father shouted at him The Prophet was then asked to leave
 the house by his father. Ibrahim(as) was sad for his father, for he had turned him away. He realized he could do nothing more, so he left home and
 walked away. He then went to the other people
 in his kingdom, to  guide them! He realized that it was his mission
to call people back to Allah(swt)! Ibrahim(as) went to the market
and shouted to them. “Allah(swt) is the one and
only true God. There is no other God,
 but Allah(swt). There is nobody worthy of
 worship except him. I will not bow down to the
 idols anymore. The people at the market got really angry  when they heard him speak like this. “Why do you worship these idols”
he asked them. “Don’t you realize that they
 have no power?” The people threatened
him to go away, so Ibrahim(as) had to leave
 the market. But the Prophet thought of a plan to show them that the idols
were not real Gods. One day there was a big celebration
 near the river bank, and the Prophet knew that
 everyone in the city would be present there. The Prophet waited  till he was sure that there was
 nobody left in the town. He then took an axe, and went inside the temple. There were many idols kept
 inside the temple, and the Prophet started smashing
the idols with his Axe!! One by one, he smashed
 all the idols, except for one, that was the biggest idol
 inside the temple.  He hung the axe around the
neck of this statue, and left the temple. The next day, when the people of the town came
to the temple to worship, they were shocked to see the idols
smashed into pieces! The pieces were lying around,
 all over the place. They gathered together
 and discussed who could have done
 this terrible act. “There was a young man at
 the market yesterday” one of them said. “He was speaking
against our gods” “I know this person- His name was Ibrahim”
said the other The people found Prophet Ibrahim(as), and brought him
 to the temple. “Are you the one who has done
these to our Gods?” They asked him ""It was the statue here,
yes that big one” the Prophet replied. “Why don’t you ask him, he will tell you if he can speak” This angered the people further. “You know very well that these
 idols do not speak.” Then Prophet Ibrahim(as) said “Then why do you worship these
idols who cannot speak,  nor do they see or hear. Have you lost your minds?” The people were ashamed and
looked around, and they saw the shattered pieces of
 idols lying everywhere. Some of them realized that Ibrahim(as)
was saying the truth. But the others were still
very angry with him “Punish him” they shouted. They wanted to take revenge
 for shattering the idols! They tied him in chains, and gathered around to discuss how they were going to punish
 the Prophet. “Lets burn him in fire” one of them said. “Lets build the biggest fire anyone
has ever seen, and throw him into it. Everyone thought it was a great idea. The people of Babylon then started
 building a fire so large that even the birds could
 not fly above it. It was so hot that the people
 couldn’t go near it Masha Allah! That was such a great story! Hahaa.. That’s all for today, I’ll tell rest of the
 story tomorrow. Ok Baba Shall I ask you a few questions
from the story? Yes! Where was Prophet Ibrahim (as) born? Babylon! He was born
 in Babylon! Masha Allah! That's the
right answer. Now tell me what did the
Prophet's father do? I’ll give you some options. Option A- Carpenter, Option B- Sculptor, Option C- Wood Cutter This one was so easy!  It was Option B,  He was a sculptor! Hmm.. Right again! Now for the next question, Tell me why was the Prophet asked
 to leave from the house? The Prophet refused to
worship the idols, and this made his father
very angry. That’s why his father asked him
 to leave the house. Isn't that right Baba? That’s correct my son! Why were the people of Babylon
 angry at the Prophet? The Prophet wanted to teach the
 people of Babylon a lesson, so he smashed all the idols
 they worshipped. Masha Allah,  that’s the
 right answer! That’s all for today, I will tell you the remaining
 story tomorrow. Good night Good night! Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! I was waiting for you Baba! You look so excited! Yes Baba! I really
 wanted to know what happened to the Prophet! Did the people
throw him in fire? What happened to him? Haha.. Alright I will tell you
the rest of the story now. Listen carefully. Bismillah! Prophet Ibrahim (as)
and the great fire! When people realized that
it was Prophet Ibrahim (as) who had destroyed the idols they were really angry! They decided to burn him
in the biggest fire anyone had seen before! First they dug a deep hole to put the firewood. They gathered all the
wood they could find and started building a fire! The people kept adding the
woods for days and days and the fire grew
stronger and stronger. It is said that the
fire grew so strong that no one could go near
it because of the heat. It was so tall that not even
the birds could fly above it! Many people heard about
this huge fire in Babylon and travelled to the city
to witness this phenomenon! Then one day the people tied the
hands and feet of Ibrahim(as) and placed him on a catalpult so that he could be
thrown into the fire. It was then that an angel from
heaven appeared before the prophet and asked him if he wanted
any wish to be granted. The prophet could have
easily asked the angel to save him from the fire but he did not. “I only wish for Allah (swt)
to be pleased with me"" he said. What followed was a miracle! When the prophet
landed in the fire the fire suddenly got cold. It only burned the ropes
that tied the prophet and no harm came to the prophet! The prophet sat there
amidst the fire as if he was sitting
in a garden! He sat there and sang
praises of Allah(swt)! The people couldn’t see
what was happening so they waited for the
fire to finish burning. And finally when
the fire went out the prophet walked out of the fire
with not a single burn in his body! The people were
shocked to see this.! This was a miracle!! “The God of Ibrahim(as)
must be the true god” some of them said. But most of them
were still angry with the prophet for
destroying the idols! They decided to take the prophet
for a trial to the king's palace. The soldiers came and
arrested the prophet and took him to the
palace of King Nimrod He was taken to the palace with his hands chained. Nimrod had heard that the
prophet had shattered the idols he worshipped. “Tell me why you smashed
the idols we worship” He asked the prophet ‘They were false idols they were not God” replied the prophet “Then who is the true
God ?” Nimrod asked The prophet politely replied “There is only one true God Allah (swt).. He gives
life and death” The king got angry when
he heard the prophet. He stood up angrily and said “I can give life and death too. Wait and I’ll show you” He asked his soldiers to bring two
of his slaves to the courtroom. He asked the slaves to
kill the first one. The guard on hearing the order struck the sword and
killed one of the slave. “You see I can give death” said Nimrod proudly. “Now kill the other one too” said Nimrod to the guard. But before the guard could
strike the slave with his sword he asked him to stop. He then shouted to the guard “Don’t kill him let him live” ” He then turned to
the prophet and said “I can give life too
you just saw that” The prophet replied “Allah(swt) make the
sun rise from the east can you make the sun
rise from the west. Can you do that?” Nimrod was speechless! He was really angry with the
prophet for confronting him! Prophet Ibrahim (as) called the
people to worship Allah(swt) for a long long time. There were nobody willing
to listen in Babylon except for one man and a woman! The woman's name was Sarah and later she became his wife. The man’s name was Lut who would later become
a prophet as well! After years of calling
people to Allah(swt) the prophet realized
that nobody else was going to listen
to his words. So he decided to migrate
to another country. He wanted to spread the message
of Allah(swt) in another nation. The prophet then asked
his father to join him but he refused. The prophet, the woman and
Lut (as) then started their long long journey! They travelled through Syria Palestine and Egypt calling out
the people to Allah (swt). They helped the poor they
could find on the way and they did many good deeds
that made people happy! In the meantime the prophet Lut (as)
migrated to the Dead Sea and settled down there. And after a few months the Prophet married Sarah! She was a good believer and they wanted to have children who would spread the message of
Allah(swt) after their time. The prophet and his wife
travelled again for many days through the desert. One day they happened to enter
the territory of an evil king. The evil king came to know about
the beautiful wife of the prophet and he wanted to take her. So he send one of his soldiers
to bring the prophet to him. The soldier brought the
prophet before the king. “Who is the lady accompanying
you?” asked the evil king The prophet replied that
she was his sister. The evil king then asked the prophet
to bring Sarah to his court. He said that he wanted to
meet this beautiful woman that everyone in his
kingdom was talking about. The prophet went to
his wife and said “The king wants to meet you” “Do not ever tell him
that you are my wife because I’ve told him
that you are my sister” the prophet told his wife. When Sarah went to
the King’s palace the king was struck
by her beauty and he tried to take hold
of her with his hands! But the moment his
hand got near Sarah it became stiff and he
could not move it!! The king was scared
that he requested Sarah “Please pray to
Allah (swt) for me and I will never harm you” When Sarah prayed to Allah (swt) his hands got cured
miraculously!! But the moment he realized
that his hands were cured the foolish king tried to
take hold of Sarah again!! And for the second time
his hands got stiff. The king couldn’t move
his hands at all!! “Please pray to Allah
(swt) for me.. I shall never harm you
again!”said the king. Sarah prayed to Allah again and his hands got cured
for the second time. This time the King
realized that Sarah was no ordinary woman. So he gave Sarah a gift! He gave her one of his
Egyptian maid servant and her name was Hajar! When Sarah returned home the prophet asked
her what happened? “Allah (swt) taught
that evil king a lesson and he gave me maid-
Hajar” replied Sarah Years passed and the
prophet grew old. His hair grayed but he continued to call
people back to Allah (swt). Sarah too had grown old and she realized that
she would no longer be able to give
birth to a child. So she asked the prophet to
marry their servant Hajar. She then prayed to Allah(swt)
to bless them with a child! After a few months Hajar gave birth to a child and they named him Ismail! By now the prophet
had grown very old! One day the prophet woke up he felt like Allah(swt)
wanted him to do something. So he went to Hajar. “Get Ismail” He said “Get ready for a long journey” Ibrahim (as) and his wife
with the baby in her arms kept travelling for
a long long time. They walked for many days till they
reached a dry valley of the desert near the Al-Marwah mountain. There were no fruits no trees no food and
no water either! No signs of any life could
be found in the valley The prophet then left
his wife and son with a small amount
of food and water. This was hardly enough for both
of them to last for two days!! The prophet then turned around
and started walking away. His wife hurried after him “Where are you going leaving us in this
barren valley?” she cried to him. But the prophet did
not answer her and kept walking away. She called him again but the prophet remained
silent and walked away! Finally she understood that the
prophet was not acting on his own. She realized that Allah(swt)
had commanded him to do this. ""Did Allah(swt) command
you to do so?” she asked him. The Prophet shook his head
and continued walking. Then his great wife said “We are not going to be lost since Allah(swt) who
commanded you is with us” The prophet was very sad as he had left his wife and
his son in a barren desert where there were
no other people. He prayed to Allah(swt) to give
his wife and son enough food. And he asked Allah(swt) to send
people with good hearts to them Oh no.. Why did the Prophet
leave his wife and son? Why did he do that? It was because Allah(swt)
had commanded him.. Hmm.. What happened next? I will tell you the
remaining story tomorrow. Ok baba. Before I leave let me ask you a few questions. Are you ready? I am ready!! Alright. Now tell me why was the
prophet thrown into the fire? Here are the options Option A- Because He had smashed
the idols they worshipped Option B- He stole their idols and Option C- He
burned the idols That’s an easy one The prophet was thrown in fire because he smashed the idols
the people worshipped! Masha Allah.. that’s
the right answer. Thank you Baba How did the prophet
challenge King Nimrod? The prophet asked the king if he could
make the sun rise from the west! Isn't that right? That’s right again. Now tell me who accompanied the
Prophet when he left Babylon The prophet's cousin
Lut joined him and another believer Sarah
too accompanied him That’s very good! Hmm.. What was the name of
the Prophet's first son? It was Ismail (as)!! Masha Allah..!
That’s right again! Its time for me to leave. Insha Allah..! I’ll tell you
the remaining story tomorrow. Assalamu Alaikum ! Are you ready for
 today's story?  I cant wait to know what happened
 to them in the desert Hahaa.. So excited huh? Alright Let me start from where
 we stopped yesterday Bismillah! The test of Prophet Ibrahim (as) Prophet Ibrahim (as) left his
wife and his son son in a barren desert as
commanded by Allah (swt). He had left them with a small amount
 of food and water, that would hardly last
 for two days! He walked away praying that they would be
 found by good people. Hajar (ra) drank the water that
the prophet had left, so that she could feed her son The water got over very soon, and both of them started
 getting very thirsty. After sometime the baby started
getting thirsty, and started to cry! She ran to a hill closeby
called Al Marwah, hoping that she might
find somebody She stood there hoping to find somebody,
 but she did not!! Then she ran to the next mountain
called Al Safa, hoping to find someone
 from there! But she couldn’t find anyone
from there either! She kept running between these
mountains seven times! When she climbed Al Marwah
for the last time, she was very tired. She got so tired that she sat
 next to her baby. It was then that she
 heard a voice! She kept quiet, and waited to
hear the voice again. When she heard the voice for
 the second time, she said “O, whoever you
might be, you have made me
 hear your voice! Have you got something
 to help me?” That was when she saw an angel
digging the earth! The angel kept digging till the
 water flowed from it! It was a miracle! When she saw the water, she ran toward it, and started to build a
basin around it. She scooped the water with her
 hands and drank from it. Then she filled her water bag, and ran
 towards her child. This place where the water rose
 is called Zam Zam. After a few days, some people were
travelling through Mecca. They saw the birds flying
around Al Marwah, and they thought the birds might be
flying around the water. They started walking
 towards Al Marwah. When they arrived, they were surprised to find a woman with
 a baby sitting near the water! “Shall we stay here and use
 this water please?” They asked her. Hajar said yes, and they drank water
 from the Zam Zam Like that many others came
 to Al Marwah, and eventually settled down there. The whole valley became
 alive now, and she and her child were
 not alone anymore! Ismail(as) grew up and learned
Arabic from the people who had settled down
 at Al Marwah. He was a good boy, and his virtues and qualities made
the people admire him. He kept thinking about his father, and knew that his father will
 come back someday! Ismail (as) then married
 a local woman, and lived his life in peace. In the meantime, Prophet Ibrahim (as) was very sad  because he had not seen his
 son for a very long time. One day, he decided to go to Mecca to meet
 his wife and his son. He travelled for many days and finally
arrived at Al Marwah! But it was very late. When he arrived, people told
him that Hajar  had died sometime ago. The prophet was very
sad to hear this and then then the local people told the
 prophet that his son, Ismail(as) was still alive!  The prophet was very happy
 to hear this,  and thanked Allah (swt)! When Ismail (as) saw his father, he ran to him and hugged
 him very tightly. He could not believe his eyes!! He was very happy to see his father
 after a long long time. It was a very happy time
for both of them But one day, Allah(swt) decided to test Ibrahim(as). One night when the prophet
was sleeping,  he saw a dream! In his dream, the prophet saw himself killing his son
 as a sacrifice to Allah (swt). The prophet woke up, and ignored it as it was
just a dream But the next night, he saw the same dream again!. This time he realized that this was
not just a dream, and that Allah was asking him to
sacrifice his own son! The prophet went to his son,  and told him about the dream. Ismail (as) realized that it was an
order from Allah(swt). “Do what Allah(swt) has
 asked you to” He told his father. The next day, the prophet took a rope
 and a knife, and set out for mount Arafat, along with his son. Upon reaching the top
of the mountain Ismail (as) asked his father to tie
his hand and legs, so that he may not struggle
 during the sacrifice. The prophet obliged, and tied
 his hands and legs. Then he blindfolded himself so that he wont have to
watch his son suffer. The prophet raised his knife, but then suddenly he heard the
 voice from the sky. He took off his blindfold, and saw a sheep being
 sent from heaven. Allah(swt) had sent the sheep to be
 sacrified instead of Ismail. The prophet was really happy, because his son was going to be alive! The prophet and his son had just passed a difficult test
 from Allah (swt) Ibrahim (as) slaughtered the sheep, and they had a big celebration. The prophet and his son kept calling
 people to worship Allah(swt) They didn’t have any place to
 worship Allah(swt) so one day Allah(swt) ordered the
 prophet to build a house!! Allah (swt) has ordered me
 to build a Kabbah"" the prophet said to his son. And Ismail (as) replied, “Do what your God has
ordered you to do”. The prophet then asked his son  if he help him build the kabbah, and Ismail(as) agreed. They started building the
 foundation of the kabbah. Ismail (as) brought the stones, while Ibrahim (as) built the house. When the walls got tall, Ismail (as) brought a large stone
 for the prophet to work by standing on it. This stone was called
Maqam-e-Ibrahim. When they completed the foundation, and built the corners, Ibrahim(as) asked Ismail(as) to find
the stone to fill the corner. “I feel tired” Ismail (as) said to his father. But when  Ibrahim(as) insisted, Ismail(as) went searching
 for the stone. While he was gone, an angel got the
prophet a stone. The angel told him that this stone was brought to
earth by Adam(as) from Paradise! The stone was originally white however its color gradually
turned into black because of the sins commited
by people on earth. Ismail(as) returned
after sometime and when he saw the stone he was surprised and asked his
father where it came from. “It was brought by someone who never
gets tired” replied Ibrahim(as) And they finally completed
building the Kabbah They prayed to Allah (swt)
to accept their work Allah(swt) was very happy with the prophet and his son
for spreading his message. And proclaimed the
pilgrimage among men they will come to thee on foot and on every kind of camel lean an account of journeys through deep
 and distant mountain highways. The prophet grew old and so did his wife Sarah. One day when he was
sitting outside his house he saw three men coming
towards his house. The three men were actually
angels sent by Allah (swt). The prophet welcome them
inside to have food. The strangers went in and
sat down for food. The Prophet served them
 a roasted calf! But the strangers did not touch
 the food at all. The prophet started to fear. Then the angels comforted
the prophet and asked him not
to fear at all. They told him that they were actually
the angels sent by Allah (swt). They informed him that they
 came to his house to deliver a good news. They said that Allah (swt) was going to give them a son and that he should name
 him Ishaaq. They also told him that his son
 would be a prophet. Sarah could not believe
 her ears! ""How could that be true”
she wondered. “I am so old” Then the angels said all these things are
 possible with Allah (swt). After a few months Sarah got pregnant and
gave birth to a child! The prophet named him Ishaaq(as) as the angels told him. After a few years Prophet Ibrahim missed his
son Ismail (as) badly so he went to see him. But when the prophet reached the
house of Ismail (as) he was not at home. His wife came out and when the prophet asked
her about Ismail(as) she replied “He has gone in search
of livelihood”. He then asked her how was
their living conditions to which she started complaining
 about everything! She complained that they were
living in misery and hardship and many other things. She was not at all grateful to
the blessings of Allah (swt) The prophet realized that she
 was not at all a suitable wife for his son so left her a message that
his son would understand. “When your husband returns convey my salutations to him” he said “and also tell him to change the
threshold of the gate”. The prophet then went
back to his home. When Ismail(as) returned
home in the evening he felt something unusual “Did anyone visit us today?” he asked her. She replied yes and
passed on the message. When Ismail(as) heard
 the message he realized that it was
 his father who visited him that day and he understood the
message that he gave her. “It was my father and he has advised
me to divorce you. You can go back to your family” He told her. His wife went back to her house and Ismail (as) married
another woman. After a long time Prophet Ibrahim (as) again
missed his son badly so he visited his new house
 once again. When he arrived it was his new wife who
answered the door. The prophet asked the
 same questions he had asked his former wife. But this time when she answered the prophet realized that she was
a very grateful and kind woman. She kept thanking Allah(swt) for the wonderful
things going on around and the prophet was very happy. “When your husband comes home give him my regards” The prophet told Ismail’s(as) wife. He also added “And also tell him that he should keep
the threshold of this gate firm”. He left after asking her to
deliver this secret message In the evening when
Ismail (as) came back he asked his wife if anyone
had come to visit him. When his wife told him about the
 prophet and the message Ismail (as) was very happy. “It was my father”
 said Ismail(as) “and you are the threshold
 of the gate. He asked me to keep
you with me forever” said the prophet happily!! Prophet Ibrahim (as) lived for One hundred 
and seventy five years! He lived a life full of trials but he had a strong faith
 in Allah (swt)!! The life of Prophet Ibrahim (as) teaches us to love Allah(swt) 
unconditionally. Even though there are 
more than 25 prophets mentioned in the Quran Allah(swt) mentions only two prophets ideal for whole humanity and they were Prophet
Muhammed (as) and Prophet Ibrahim (as) Mashallah! That was such an amazing story! Hmm.. So you liked the
story of Ibrahim(as)? I loved it Baba! Ha haa.. Alright now let me ask you
a few questions from the story. Shall I? Go ahead Tell me the names of the mountains
that Hajar (ra) ran across? Hmmm.. They were Al
Safa and Al Marwah That’s the right answer. Now tell me how the travelers
found the prophet's wife. I’ll give you three options. Option A) They saw animals
running towards the mountain. Option B) They saw water
flowing down the mountain. Option C) They saw birds
flying above the mountain It was option C! Hmm..! The travelers saw the
birds flying above the mountain! Haha..That’s right again! The next question. How did God test Ibrahim (as)? I know that one. God asked Ibrahim (as) to sacrifice
his only son Ismail (as) And did he sacrifice his son? No! Just before the sacrifice God told the prophet
that he was testing him and God send a sheep
instead for the sacrifice Mashallah that’s
the right answer. You are doing great my son. Thank you baba Why did the color of the stone
that the angels brought turn from white to black? Hmm.. It was because of the sins committed 
by the people on earth. Excellent! And now for the last question What was the name of the second 
son of the prophet? It was Ishaaq (as)! Isn't that right baba? Yes my son, that’s
the right answer. That’s all for today. Insha Allah! I will tell you the
story of another prophet tomorrow Which story are you going
to tell me tomorrow? Insha Allah!I will tell you the story
of Prophet Ismail (as) tomorrow Thanks Baba! Good night! Good night!"
"Wow! The sky is full
of stars tonight! Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam Baba What were you looking at Amir? Come here Baba,
and look at this! What is it? Look at the sky Baba! Its..Its so beautiful! Masha Allah!
 Its really beautiful! Are you going to tell
me a story tonight? Of course I will! Insha Allah, I think I will tell you the
story of Prophet Shammil (as) today! Masha allah!
That’s great Prophet Shammil or Samuel (as) was
a revered Prophet and a seer! Are you ready? Yes I am! Now listen carefully Bismillah! The Story of Prophet
Shammil (as) As time passed, the children of Israel started forgetting
Allah (swt) and they committed many sins! They had a tyrant King who ill treated
them and spilled their blood. He dragged the country to frequent wars,
and depleted the resources of the country. The children of Israel used to go to
war carrying the  "" Ark of the Covenant” with them. They did so because they believed that
this Ark would bring them good luck. They one every war, until one day, the
Phalistine army snatched the Ark from them! Not only did they lose the Ark,
they lost the war as well! When the King heard what happened, he suffered
a heart attack, and died on the spot! The children of Israel were
now left without a king. They were now like a sheep
without a shepherd. It was then that God sent them
a Prophet named Shammil (as) They were now very happy! They asked the Prophet to appoint
a strong leader, so that they could fight
against the Philistines and take back the Ark. Prophet Shammil(as) knew their weakness 
and warned them  “I fear that you may refuse when the
 time of fight arrives”. But the people assured the Prophet that they
were ready to fight in the way of Allah(swt) That night, the Prophet
prayed to Allah(swt) for guidance. It was then that Allah(swt) informed the
 Prophet that He had selected a man  named Talut to be their King. But the Prophet
was confused now. “How will I recognize this man?” 
He asked God. Then God told him that Talut would come
to Shammil in sometime by himself. Shammil(as) was instructed to hand over
the control of the kingdom to Talut. Talut was a tall, sturdy and very 
intelligent man who lived with his father  in a farm far away. He lived and worked with
his father in that farm. One day, Talut, accompanied by his servant
were out looking for his missing donkeys. They travelled for many days searching for
the donkeys, but they could not find them. “Let us go back” 
said Talut to his servant. “My father would have started
 worrying by now, and there are other animals to be
 taken care of” “Master” replied the servant. “This is the land where
Prophet Shammil(as) lives. I think we should go
and pay him a visit” “We can also ask him
about the lost donkeys” Talut agreed that it was a good
idea, and went to meet the Prophet. On their way, they asked the directions
from some women carrying water. The women told them that they can find the
Prophet’s house on top of the mountain. Talut and his servant walked up the
mountain as they had been told. When they finally arrived at the place, they saw a large crowd in front of the
 house of the Prophet! Talut saw Prophet Shammil(as) standing in 
front of the crowd, and immediately realized that He was
 indeed a Holy man! The Prophet saw Talut standing
at a distance, and he recognized that Talut was the chosen one
to become the King of Israel. Talut greeted the
Prophet respectfully. He then asked the Prophet
about his missing donkeys. “Don’t worry” replied
the Prophet. “The donkeys are already on their
way to your father’s farm” The Prophet then informed Talut that Allah(swt)
 had chosen him to lead the children of Israel. The Prophet told him that Talut was
to take charge of their affairs. He was to unite them under one banner,
and to protect them from their enemies. Talut was surprised by this
sudden honor offered to him! It was also a huge
responsibility! He told the Prophet that he didn’t
know anything about leadership, and neither did he
have any wealth! But the Prophet calmed him by saying
that it was the will of Allah (swt). Prophet Shammil(as) introduced Talut as the
next King to the children of Israel. But the people were not happy. “He is from Binyamin’s
tribe” shouted one “He is not wealthy from
birth” shouted another “How can he be a king over us, when we
have greater right to kingship than he?” “He doesn’t have any wealth” But the Prophet
answered them calmly “Allah has indeed appointed
Talut as the King over you” “He has increased him abundantly
in knowledge and stature. Allah(swt) grants His kingdom
to whom He wills. He is the all wise” After a long argument, the people demanded that if the long lost chest
 contain the belongings of Prophet Musa  was restored, they would accept Talut
 as their King. Talut was appointed as the King, and he
immediately set about organizing his army. He ordered that only men free from
responsibilities should join the army. He asked those building homes, 
those who were about to be married, and those who were engaged in business 
not to join the army. He put them through vigorous trainings
and gave them strict rules to follow. After a few days, Talut set out
for the war against the Philistines They travelled for many days
and nights through the desert After days of travelling, they reached 
the banks of a river. Talut decided to put his army 
to go through a test. “You are allowed to drink
water from the river, but only to quench your
thirst, not more than that” He ordered them But the soldiers were really tired, and
many of them drank more than they needed Talut was disappointed
when he found this. He immediately discharged
them for disobedience. He kept only those who had
proved their sincerity. Like this, he put his army
 through several tests, and by the time they came face to face
 with the Philistine Army, there were only about 30
soldiers left with him. But Talut was not bothered. He believed in quality,
and not in numbers. He thought it was better to be a
small band of true believers, rather than a huge army
of unreliable men. With this small army, he
faced the Philistine army, who were very strong and
armed with better weapons. They were led by Goliath, a mighty warrior from Philistine. He was a gigantic person, known for his 
huge build and brute strength. A great number of Talut’s men ran
away when they saw such a huge army. What happened then? Who won the war? I will tell you about
that tomorrow! Masha allah! That was
such an amazing story. Now.. Are you ready
for the questions? Yes, I am! Alright, now here is
the first question. What did the Children of Israel lose
after their war with the Philisitine’s? Was it because they
had lost the Ark? That’s correct! Now tell me what did the children
of Israel ask Prophet Shammil (as) They asked the Prophet to
appoint a King to lead them Masha Allah!
 That’s correct again! How did Talut find the Prophet? Talut was searching for his lost donkeys, and they wandered to the land
 where the Prophet lived. And, why did they go
and meet the Prophet? Talut’s servant thought that the Prophet would 
be able to say where their donkeys were. Masha Allah! 
That’s great.. You are doing great Amir! Thank you Baba Which tribe did Talut belong to? He belonged to the
tribe of Binyamin! That’s correct again! Now for the last question, who was the leader of
the Philistine army? It was Goliath! Insha Allah! 
You did great my son I will see you again tomorrow, with
the story of Prophet Dawud (as) Good night Baba Good night Amir!"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum As-salam! Have you finished your
 homework Amir? Yes Baba! That’s great! So are you ready for
the story of Prophet Musa (as)? Yes baba! I really want to know
what happened to him in the desert! Alright! 
Now listen carefully! Bismillah Prophet Musa (as) Hears
the Voice of God!! Prophet Musa (as) wandered in the
desert for many days and nights! He travelled in the
direction of Midian, which was the nearest town
between Syria and Egypt. His only companion in the
desert was Allah (swt), and his only provision was piety. The hot sand burned the
soles of his feet, but fearing pursuit
by the soldiers, he forced himself to keep walking. Like this, He walked for
eight days and nights. The Prophet finally managed
to cross the desert, and he reached the
outskirts of Midian. After walking for some more time, he
reached a watering hole outside the city. As soon as he
reached the spring, he threw himself under a
tree to rest for sometime. As he caught his breath, he noticed two women standing 
aside with their sheep. They were standing far away, hesitant to approach the crowd The Prophet sensed that
the women needed help. So being a man of honor,
he ignored his thirst, and went to them. “Can I help you in any way? Why are you standing
aside?” He asked them Then the older sister replied “We are waiting until the men
finish watering their sheep. “Why are you waiting”
He asked them again “We are helpless” 
they said. “Our father is very old, and he doesn’t have the
strength to face this crowd . If we go forward, these strong
men will push us aside.. So when these people
are finished, then we take our
animals to the water. Its our daily routine”
they explained. The Prophet took the women’s sheep
 to the waterhole, where he easily pushed in
 amongst the men. When He approached the water, he saw that the shepherds had put
a large rock to cover the well. The Prophet single handedly 
lifted the rock, and he let the animals drink. The people standing there were
 awestruck when they saw him lifting the stone
with just one hand!! He then returned to sit
in the shade of the tree. That’s when He realized that
he had forgotten to drink! “O Lord” He prayed, “Whatever
good you can bestow on me, I am surely in need of it now. When the daughters returned home
 earlier than usual,  their father was surprised! The daughters then explained what happened
at the oasis, and why they reached early. Their father wanted to
thank the stranger, so he sent one of his daughters to
invite the stranger to his home! One of the daughters returned
to the Prophet and told him “My father wants to reward
you for your kindness, and He invites you to our home” He agreed, and accompanied
the maiden to her father. When they reached the house, the Prophet introduced himself, and
told him the story of his life. He then told them why He
had to flee from Egypt. The Old man comforted Him “Be grateful to Allah(swt) that you have
managed to escape from those tyrants! You need not be afraid now!” The Old man and his daughters really liked
the gentle behavior of the Prophet. They invited him to stay
with them for a few days, and the Prophet was more than
happy to accept their invitation. The hosts soon realized that the
Prophet was a trustworthy man. One day, the Old man
approached Him and said “I wish to marry you to
one of my daughters” The Prophet was
happy to hear this “But on one condition”
the old man added. “You must agree to work for me for
a period of eight years” He said The Prophet was a stranger
in a strange land. Exhausted and alone, this
offer suited Him very much. He married the Midianite’s daughter and
looked after his animals for ten long years! Time passed, and he stayed far away
from his family and his people. This period of ten years, was
very important for the Prophet. It was a time for major preparation. Musa (as) completed ten years
of service as He had promised. One day, suddenly He was
overcome by homesickness. He started missing his family
and the Land of Egypt! He desperately wanted
to return to Egypt. That night he went
to His wife and said “We shall leave for
Egypt tomorrow” His wife agreed and they started
packing their belongings. Musa (as) left Midian with his family
and travelled through the desert. They traveled for many days, and
finally reached near Mount Sinai. “I think we have lost our
way” said the Prophet. The Prophet was confused, so He
decided to camp there for the night. He then left searching for
firewood to light up a fire. He kept searching, and
reached Mount Tur. As He walked, he noticed a fire
burning on the top of the mountain! Musa (as) walked
towards the fire, and as he did, he heard a voice! “O Musa, I am Allah, the Lord
of the Universe” said the voice The Prophet realized that it
was indeed God talking to Him, and so he walked
towards the fire. Allah,then asked the Prophet to remove his
shoes as he was standing on a Holy Ground God then revealed to Him that He had
been chosen for a special mission, and asked Him to follow
His instructions. “And what is it in your right hands?” 
Allah(swt) asked Him “This is my staff” 
He replied “on which I lean, and with which I
beat down the branches for my sheep” “Throw down your staff”
the voice commanded. And no sooner did the Prophet
throw down the staff, that it turned into
a wriggling snake! Musa (as) was frightened,
and he started to run!! But the voice said
“Fear not and grasp your stick, we shall return it
to its former state” The Prophet was terrified
 of the snake. He then trusted the Voice, and
placed His hand over the snake. It immediately transformed
back into his staff again!! The fear of Musa (as) subsided and
 was replaced by peace, as he realized that he was indeed
 talking to God. Next, Allah(swt) commanded him to
put his hand inside the robe. The Prophet did as commanded, and 
when he pulled his hand out, it was shining brilliantly! Allah(swt) then commanded him to go
to Egypt, and face the Pharaoh. He told him that the Pharaoh
had become arrogant, and was suppressing
the Israelites. Musa (as) feared that he would be arrested
if He returned to Egypt, so he said “O Allah! I have killed a man among
them, and I fear they will kill me!” Then Allah (swt) comforted
 him by saying “Go and deliver this
message to them. Show them the path of the truth. Take your brother
Haroon, to assist you. They will not be able to harm 
you at all” Allah(swt) assured him of his safety,
and the Prophet was convinced. What happened next? I will tell you that tomorrow! Mashallah! That was such a great story! Now are you ready
for the questions? Yes Baba! Alright, now tell me why did
the Prophet escape from Egypt? The Prophet had killed an Egyptian, and
that’s why he had to flee from Egypt That’s right! How did the Prophet find a
place to stay in Midian? The Prophet helped the daughters of
an Old Midianite to fetch water. That’s why the family gave
him food and shelter. How long did Prophet Musa (as)
 stay in Midian? 8 years! No wait, it was 10 years!!
Isnt that right? That’s correct my son! Now tell me the name of the mountain where
the Prophet found the burning flame? It was Mount Tur!! Mashallah! That was
excellent my son. I’ll see you again tomorrow.
Good night! Good night baba!"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum- Assalam! Did the Prophet go to Egypt Baba? What happened then? You look so excited! Please tell me the rest
of the story Baba! Inshallah! I will tell you story of how
Prophet Musa (as) confronted the Pharaoh. Are you ready? Yes! Bismillah! The Story of Musa (as) in Egypt! In the last episode, we saw how Allah
(swt) ordered Musa (as) to go to Egypt, for delivering his message. The Prophet, then took His family and
set off in the direction of Egypt. They walked for many days, and
finally they arrived in Egypt. When they reached outside the city, his brother- Haroon (as),
was waiting for him! Haroon (as) was a
Prophet as well. He had received a
vision from God, and in the vision He had seen that His
younger brother would soon arrive, to set the Israelites free! When Musa (as) realized
that this was his brother, he was in tears!! Then Both of them walked
toward the Palace. The Prophet had not been
to Egypt for many years, and He knew that His
life was in danger. Nothing could have brought Him back
except the command of Allah (swt). Prophet could still hear the words
of Allah(swt) ringing in his ears “Go to the Pharoah and tell him to let
the Israelites leave the land of Egypt” Musa (as) now stood in front of the
Pharaoh along with his brother. The Prophet spoke to the Pharaoh
about Allah and His mercy. But the Pharaoh refused to listen
because he considered himself as a God! He listened to the Prophet’s
speech with disdain. He thought the Prophet was crazy
to question his supreme position. After the prophet finished delivering
 Allah’s message, the Pharaoh raised his hand and asked “What do you want?” “I want you to send the children of
Israel with us” answered the Prophet “The Israelites are my slaves, why
should I send them with you?” “They are not your slaves, they
are the slaves of Allah (swt)” This answer angered the Pharaoh. “Are you not Musa?” The Prophet shook his
head, and answered Yes “We picked you up from river Nile,
 and brought you up, didn’t we” asked the Pharaoh. “Are you not  Musa, who
killed an Egyptian man? You are a fugitive of justice and
how dare you come and speak to me?” The Prophet ignored his sarcasm, and explained that he killed the
Egyptian in an accident,  it was never deliberate. He then informed the Pharaoh that
Allah(swt) had granted him forgiveness, and that He was now one
of his messengers. The Pharaoh asked Musa (as) to show a sign
to prove that he was the messenger of God. The Prophet threw his
stick to the floor, and it turned into a serpent!! It started slithering and
sliding along the floor! The Pharaoh was
terrified at first, but he tried hard
not to show it. “Ha!” said the
Pharaoh arrogantly, “we have many sorcerers in our
kingdom who can match your magic! The Pharaoh detained the Prophet
and His brother at the Palace. He then summoned all the magicians
in his kingdom to the palace. The Pharaoh promised huge rewards to them  if their magic was found better
 than the Prophet’s. The day for the contest arrived, and
the palace was crowded with people. The magicians stood on one side  and the Prophet
and His brother stood opposite to them. Everyone in the palace
took the side of Pharaoh, and the Prophet and His
brother stood alone. Musa (as) asked the
magicians to perform first. It is said that there were more than
seventy magicians lined up in a row!. The magicians threw their sticks and ropes, and suddenly the ground floor was
flooded with a sea of serpents! They were writhing and
slithering everywhere! The crowd was amazed
when they saw this, and they thought the Prophet was never
going to beat such powerful magic. Musa (as) was afraid too, but he
knew that God was on His side. The Prophet threw his stick
to the floor, and suddenly it transformed into
a huge serpent!! The serpent then ate all other
small ones lying on the ground!! When the crowd saw this, they stood up
like a wave, cheering for the Prophet! The magicians were
surprised as well! They knew that this
was not just a trick, and that the serpent was real! They realized that Musa was not
just a magician or a sorcerer The magicians knew that Musa’s
power came from something greater, so they fell on their knees
seeking forgiveness from Allah(swt). Allah(swt)  forgave them, but
the Pharaoh grew furious. “How can you believe in his God,
before I gave you my permission?” He asked them angrily But the magicians replied “Do what you wish,  but we fear the punishment of Allah(swt)
 much more than you” The Pharaoh got angry
when he heard this. He now realized that
he had a problem, as the Prophet kept asking
him to free the Israelites. His kingdom was built on the
fear of the Israelites, and everyone believed
him to be the God. He was now worried that his kingdom
was about to be unraveled. The Pharaoh felt threatened, and he summoned all the ministers,
 leaders for a serious meeting. “Am I a liar, O Haman?” He opened
the session with this question Haman stood up, and asked “Who
dared to accuse you of lying?” “Didn’t Musa say that there
is a Lord in Heaven?” “Musa is lying” said Haman. The Pharaoh then ordered to kill
 and torture all those who followed the Prophet! The soldiers then started
torturing the Israelites. They slayed the men, and not
even the babies were spared. They imprisoned anyone who
dared to oppose them. The Prophet stood watching their
 horrific acts helplessly. He asked the people to be patient, and asked them to have faith in Allah (swt) God commanded Musa (as) to warn the Pharaoh
that he and the Egyptians would suffer a severe punishment if the children
of Israel were not set free. The Prophet agreed, and went
to meet the Pharaoh again! He then made another demand to release
the Israelites, But the Pharaoh refused. It was then that God afflicted Egypt 
with a severe drought.  Even the lush, green and 
fertile valleys of Nile began to wither and die. The crops failed, and the
animals began to die. Even as the Egyptians suffered
 because of the famine, the Pharaoh refused to obey,
 and he remained arrogant. Then God sent a huge flood to
devastate the Land of Egypt! Villages were drowned, the crops were
destroyed and many Egyptians were killed! Then the people, including the
chief ministers appealed to Musa “Musa” they cried “Please help us. We shall believe in you and your God, 
if you remove this punishment from us! We shall let the children of Israel
 go with you! The Prophet then prayed to God,
and the Land returned to normal. The land became fertile,
and the crops grew again! But the children of Israel
were still enslaved! They were not allowed
to leave as promised! The Prophet asked them to 
fulfill their promise, but they paid no heed to his request. They ignored him and walked away He prayed to God again, and this time
Allah(swt) sent plagues of locusts to Egypt The locusts attacked the crops, and
swallowed everything in their path! The people rushed to the Prophet
 begging for his help. The ministers promised to let go 
of the Israelites,  if he would send the locusts away The Prophet prayed to God again,
and the locusts departed. But even now, they didn’t let the
Israelites leave as they promised. God then sent a plague of lice,
spreading disease among the Egyptians. It was followed by a plague of frogs
that harassed and terrified the people The people rushed to the Prophet begging to
save them, every time God sent his punishments. They promised to free the
Israelites every time, but when God withdrew
the punishments, they refused to let go of them. Then the last sign- the
sign of blood was revealed. The water of the River
Nile turned into blood! The water appeared normal when the
Israelites drank from the river. However, if any Egyptian filled his cup
with water, the water turned into blood. They hurried to the Prophet as usual, and as soon as everything 
returned to normal, they turned their backs on Allah(swt) Masha Allah! 
That was such a wonderful story!! Now are you ready for the questions? Yes, I am! Alright, now tell me why did
Prophet Musa (as) return to Egypt? I know that one! God commanded the Prophet to go back
to Egypt for freeing the Israelites! That’s correct! Now tell me what were the punishments
sent by Allah(swt) in order First God sent a severe drought That’s right.. then? Then He sent a devastating flood.. Then he sent a plague of locusts
 followed by lices and frogs Excellent! And what was
the final punishment? As a final punishment, God
turned Nile water into blood! Masha Allah!
 That was excellent! Alright, now its time for me to leave, I will tell you another
story tomorrow! Good night son! Good night baba!"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! Are you going to tell me
the story of Prophets today? Yes of course!
You sound so excited! I love hearing these stories Baba. Mashallah! That’s great. Today I will tell you
 the story of Prophet Ayub (as) Who is he Baba ? Ayub (as) is a Prophet in Islam, and his name is mentioned
 in the Quran. The Quran also describes the Prophet
as a righteous servant of Allah(swt), who had to undergo the test of
 Allah(swt) for a very long period of time! Now listen carefully! Bismillah! The Story of Prophet Ayub (as) A long long time ago, there lived
 a man named Prophet Ayub (as).  He was one the grandsons
 of Prophet Yusuf (as). He had a wife named Rahma.
 Both of them led a very happy life. Allah (swt) blessed the Prophet
with many sons and daughters. He was a wealthy man, and
he owned plenty of land. He owned a large number
 of cattles as well. He was one of the sincere
worshippers of Allah (swt). He was thankful to Allah(swt) for all
the blessings endowed upon him. He loved the poor, and he
 gave them food and clothes. He always invited an orphan or
 a poor person to eat with him. One day it so happened that the Angels were discussing
about Allah(swt)’s faithful servants. “The best creature on earth
today is Ayub” said one of the angels. “He is a man of noble character, and he always remembers
 his generous Lord. He is an excellent model
 for Allah’s followers” Then another angel said “In return,  Lord has blessed him with a
 long life and plenty of servants”. “He helps the poor and the needy.
 He also buys the slaves, and set them free!
He is a very generous man” Added another angel.
Shaytan overheard their conversation, and he became very annoyed.
He decided to go to the Prophet and tempt him to go
against his God. First, he tried to distract him
from his prayers  by whispering about all the
good things in life! But Ayub (as) was a true believer, and the evil thoughts did not
 tempt him at all! When his trick failed,
Shaytan got really angry!! Shaytan then complained to Allah
about Ayub.  He said that although the Prophet
 kept praying to God, he was not a sincere person. Shaytan said that the Prophet
was trying to satisfy Allah, so that God  wont take his
wealth away from him! “If you remove his wealth,
then you will find that  he will no longer mention
 Your name!  He will even stop praying
 to you!” But Allah told Shaytan that Ayub  was one of His most sincere devotees.  The Prophet, He said, did not
worship Him because of the favors he received. Allah wanted to show Shaytan the depth of the Prophet’s sincerity. So He allowed Shaythan to do
 whatever he wished with Ayub’s wealth. Shaytan was very happy now! He gathered his helpers and
started destroying all that the Prophet owned!
He burned his farms, cattles and he didn’t leave
 his house as well! Then he destroyed all
of the Prophet’s servants. Ayub (as) was now left
 with no possessions. Rubbing his hand in glee, Shaytan then approached the
Prophet disguised as an old man! “All your wealth is lost”
He said to the Prophet.  Some people say that this is because you gave too much to others as charity. Some are saying that you are
wasting your time with your prayers! “If Allah had the power to prevent
 you from getting harmed, He would have protected you” But the Prophet’s faith was
 not shaken even a little bit.  “What Allah(swt) has taken away,
belongs to Him” He replied. “I was only a caretaker
of all of His possessions. He gives to whom who He wills, and withholds from whom He wills” With these words, the Prophet
 again prostrated to his Lord When Shaytan saw this,
he felt frustrated! So he addressed Allah (swt) again! “I have stripped Ayub of
all of his possessions, but still he remains grateful to You!” He said to the Lord. “The real test
 of a parent is through his children! You will see how he rejects you,
 when he loses his children” Allah(swt) gave Shaytan the authority
 to do what he wanted. He also warned him that the Prophet’s
 faith and patience will not reduce,  inspite of whatever Shaytan
 had planned for. Shaytan again gathered his helpers and set out to destroy the Prophet’s children. He destroyed the house in
which the sons and daughters lived, killing all of them! Then he went to the Prophet,  disguised as a man who came
 to sympathize with him. He said to the Prophet in
 a comforting tone “The circumstances under which your children died were really sad. Your Lord is not rewarding
 you properly for all your prayers” Then the Shaytan waited anxiously hoping the Prophet was
 now ready to reject Allah (swt) But the Prophet said “Allah(swt)
 sometimes gives, and sometimes takes. He is sometimes pleased,
 and sometimes displeased with what we do. Whatever happens, I will remain firm in my belief and remain
 thankful to my creator” And then, the Prophet
prostrated to his Lord. Shaytan was very angry
 when he saw that. Shaytan called to Allah again! “Oh lord” He said.
“Ayub has lost all of his wealth, and his children are dead. As long as he remains healthy,
 he will continue to worship You, hoping that he can produce
 more children. Grant me authority over
his body so that I may weaken it. He will then surely neglect worshipping, and
he will turn disobedient.” Allah (swt) wanted to teach
 Shaytan a lesson. So He granted his third request, but one one condition.
 It was that Shaytan will have authority over
the Prophet’s body but not over his soul or intellect. Shaytan was very happy,
as he knew that the Prophet was surely going to give
up on his God this time. Armed with this new authority Shaytan began to afflict the body
 of the Prophet with diseases After sometime, the Prophet was
 reduced to mere skin and bones! But the Prophet stayed strong
in his faith amidst all the sufferings. He did not despair or turn
 to others for help, and remained hopeful
 of Allah(swt)'s mercy. His close relatives, and even
friends deserted him. Only his kind and loving
wife stayed with him. She showered her kindness
on the Prophet, and cared for him in this hour of need. Shaytan had now become desperate, so he decided to approach
 the Prophet’s wife this time. He went to her in the form of a man, and asked her “Where is your husband?” She pointed to an almost lifeless form on the bed and said “There he is, hanging between
life and death” Shaytan then reminded her of the days when the Prophet was in good health, and when he had all
his wealth and children. She was suddenly overcome with
the pain of years of hardship, and she burst into tears. “How long are you going to bear this torture from our Lord” she asked him crying. “Are we
  going to remain without wealth, children or friends forever?. Why don’t you call upon Allah(swt) to
remove this suffering? The prophet sighed and
replied in a soft voice “Shaytan must have whispered
to you and made you upset. Tell me how long did I enjoy
good health and the riches?” He asked “Seventy years”
 she replied. “How long have I been
 suffering like this now?” He asked her again “Seven years” she replied The Prophet then told her “In that case,  I am ashamed to call on my Lord
to remove the hardships. I have not suffered longer than the
years of good health and prosperity!” He then told her “It seems
 your faith has weakened and you are dissatisfied with our Lord If I ever regain my health, I swear I will punish you with a
 hundred strokes” The Prophet then ordered her to leave the house and never come back again. The Prophet’s wife cried bitterly and with a heavy heart left the house. In this helpless state,
the Prophet prayed to Allah(swt) not to complain, but to
 seek His mercy. “Oh Lord” he prayed
 “Harm has inflicted me, and You are the Most Merciful” Allah (swt) accepted the
prayer of the Prophet, and turned to him with mercy. He commanded the Prophet to
 strike the earth with his foot. The Prophet obeyed the order, and suddenly a spring
arose from the ground!! He took a bath in the water
as God ordered him, and suddenly he was cured!! Meanwhile, his faithful wife could no longer bear to be
 parted from her husband, so she returned to him with
 a desire to serve him. she was amazed to see
the sudden change! The Prophet was healthy again! She embraced him and
thanked Allah(swt) for His mercy. Ayoub (as) was now worried
 about the oath he had taken. In his anger, he had taken
an oath to punish her with a hundred strokes,
 if he regained his health. He did not want to hurt her but he could not break a promise
 made to Allah as well! Allah (swt), in His wisdom and mercy,  came to solve the dilemma of
 His faithful servant. God asked him to take
 a bundle of thin grass, and gently strike his wife
with the bundle. This way the Prophet didn’t
have to break his oath!! The Prophet soon regained his wealth, and his children were
 raised from the dead! It is said that Prophet Ayoub (as)
 lived till the age of 93 years!! This story should remind us
 that Allah (swt) would test us in many ways.
We should, therefore, remain strong in our faith,
 and worship Him constantly Mashallah! That was such
 a wonderful story! Now are you ready for the questions? Yes, I am! Alright, now tell me how did  Shaytan
try to distract the Prophet, in his first attempt?  He tried to distract him from his prayers by whispering about all
 the good things in life! And did the Prophet get distracted? No.. The Prophet was a true believer, and he didn’t get distracted at all! That’s correct! Now tell me how did he test
the Prophet, the second time? Shaytan said that the Prophet
was trying to satisfy God so that God wont take away
 his wealth from him! He then burned down all the
possessions of the Prophet! Mashallah! That’s right again! And did the Prophet stop
worshipping Allah(swt) this time? No.. The Prophet said that it was God
 who gave him all his possessions, so it didn’t really matter
 when God took it back Very good! Now tell me how did
 Shaytan test him the third time? Shaytan took God’s permission to kill
all of the Prophet’s children! And did the Prophet stop praying to
 Allah(swt) after his children were killed? No, the Prophet did not stop praying
 to God, and this made Shaytan very angry! And how did he test the
Prophet for the final time? Shaytan took permission from God, and afflicted the body of
 the Prophet with diseases. And did this make the Prophet
 stop worshipping God? No.. the Prophet stayed strong in his
 faith amidst all the sufferings He did not despair or turn
 to others for help, and remained hopeful of God’s mercy Mashallah! All your answers were
 correct Amir Very good Thank you Baba! Alright, I will see you again tomorrow
 with another story. Good night my son! Good night Baba ! Asalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! What were you reading my son? I was reading a book
on Prophet Yunus (as). Is it true that the Prophet
was swallowed by a huge whale? Yes, its true my son! And did the Prophet
live after that? Yes he did. Do you want to hear
his story today? Yes, I do!
Please tell me Baba Alright.. Now listen carefully Bismillah! The Story of Prophet Yunus (as) A long long time ago, there was a city named Nineveh. The people of Nineveh
were idolaters, who lived a shameless life. Prophet Yunus (as) was
sent by Allah(swt) to Nineveh, to preach to them
about the true God. “You should believe only in
Allah(swt) and obey his commands” He told them “Otherwise a severe punishment
will come upon you” He warned them But the inhabitants of the town didn’t like anyone to interfere
 in their way of worship. “We and our forefathers have worshipped
 these Gods for many years” said an old man “And no harm has come
to us” added another Prophet Yunus (as) tried very hard to
convince the people about Allah (swt). But the people kept ignoring him He warned that if they kept
on with their foolishness, Allah(swt) will soon punish them Instead of fearing Allah(swt), they told the Prophet that they
were not afraid of his threats. “Let your God punish
us” they told him The Prophet was
disheartened by now. “In that case I will leave
you to your misery” saying that, he left
the town of Nineveh. The Prophet became
impatient and he departed without waiting for further
commands from Allah(swt). He knew that God must
be angry on him, so he decided to travel
to a distant land. As soon as the Prophet
left the city, the skies began to
change its color. It looked like
they were on fire! The people were filled
by fear at this sight! They remembered the destruction of
the people of ‘Ad, Thamud and Nuh! Slowly faith started
penetrating their hearts. The people of Nineveh gathered
on the top of a mountain, and started to pray to
Allah(swt) for His mercy. The mountains echoed
with their cries, the people of Nineveh repented
sincerely for the sins they had committed. When Allah(swt) heard
their prayers, he decided not to punish them, and He showered His blessing
upon the people once again! When the people realized
that they were saved, they prayed to Allah(swt) for
the return of Yunus (as), so that he could guide them Meanwhile, Yunus (as) had boarded a small
ship in the company of other passengers. It sailed all day in calm waters, with a
good wind blowing at the sails. But as the night came, the sea suddenly changed. There was a horrible storm, and it looked like the ship was
going to be split into pieces! The waves rose as
high as mountains, tossing the ship up and down! Everyone in the ship
were terrified! The captain of the ship
shouted to the crew to lighten the ships heavy load. The crew first threw
their baggage overboard, but this was not enough! Their safety lay in reducing
the weight further, so they decided among themselves,
that one among them  will have to be thrown into the sea. In the meantime, a large whale had
surfaced behind the ship. Allah (swt) had commanded
the whale to surface, and it had obeyed. The whale kept following the
ship as he had been commanded. And back at the ship, the captain told them “We will make lots with
all the travelers names. The one whose name is drawn
will be thrown into the sea. Yunus (as) reluctantly
participated in the lot, and his name was added as well. When the lot was drawn, the paper had “Yunus”
written on it! Since the crew knew that the Prophet
was the most honorable man among them, they didn’t want to
throw him into the sea. Therefore they decided
to draw a second lot. And when they drew the
lot for the second time, the name of the Prophet
appeared again!! The crew decided to give one
final chance to the Prophet, and drew a third lot. But the Prophet’s name appeared during
the third and final lot as well! The Prophet realized that Allah(swt) was
involved in what was going on. He realized that Allah(swt)
was punishing him, because he had abandoned the
mission without Allah (swt)'s consent. It was decided that the Prophet
should throw himself into the water. Yunus (as) stood at
the edge of the ship, looking at the furious sea. It was night and there
was no moon in the sky. The stars were hidden
behind a black fog. Before jumping into the sea, the
Prophet kept mentioning Allah(swt)’s name. He then jumped into the sea, and disappeared beneath
the huge waves. The whale that was following the ship, found the Prophet floating
on the waves. It didn’t waste anytime, and swallowed the
Prophet in one gulp! The whale shut its ivory teeth, as if they were white bolts
locking the door of his prison. It then dived to the
bottom of the sea. The Prophet imagined
himself to be dead, but his senses became alert when he figured that
he was able to move. He realized that he was alive, and knew that he was imprisoned. In his loneliness, he started to think
over what had happened in the town, and realized that he should
have never left the town. Instead, he should have stayed and
kept on speaking to the people, asking them to return to Allah(swt) In his despair, the Prophet started to
pray with all his heart to Allah(swt). “O Allah, there is no
God apart from You. You alone do I praise and honor. I have done wrong, if You do not help me, I shall be lost for ever” The Prophet continued praying
 to Allah(swt), repeating his prayers. Fishes, whales and many other creatures
that lived in the sea, heard the voice  of the Prophet's prayers,
coming from the whale's stomach All these creatures gathered
around the whale, and began to praise Allah(swt), each in its own language!! The whale also participated
in praising Allah(swt). Then he understood that he
had swallowed a Prophet! When he realized this, He felt afraid at first! He then said to himself
“Why should I be afraid? Allah(swt) commanded me
to swallow him” Allah(swt) Almighty saw the sincere
repentance of the Prophet, and He decided to save him! He commanded the whale
to go the surface, and eject the Prophet
onto the shore. The whale obeyed and swam to
the surface of the ocean. He then ejected the Prophet
onto a remote island! The Prophet was very sick
now because of the acids inside the whale’s stomach. His skin was inflamed, and when the sun rose, the rays burned his body! The Prophet was on the verge of screaming
 with pain by now.  But he endured the pain and continued
 his prayers to Allah (swt) Allah(swt) then caused
a tree to grow behind where the Prophet was praying. This tree protected the Prophet from the
 harsh rays of the sun,  and it gave him nourishing fruits as well! Gradually, he
regained his strength and found his way
back to Nineveh. He was pleasantly surprised to
notice the change that took place! The entire population of Nineveh turned out to welcome him!! They informed him that they
now worshipped Allah(swt), the one true God. The Prophet was very
happy to hear that, and he lived happily in
Nineveh until he died! Masha Allah! That was such a wonderful story! I’m glad you liked it my son. Now are you ready
for the questions? Yes I am! Alright, now tell me the name of the town where
Prophet Yunus (as) preached It was Nineveh! That was quick! Now for the next question. Why did the Prophet
leave the town? The Prophet was angry at the people of
Nineveh for not listening to his words. That’s why he left the town, even before God told him to. Mashallah!
That’s excellent my son. Now tell me why did the
Prophet jump into the sea? The ship that the Prophet was travelling
 got caught in a storm.  The captain and the crew decided that they
 will  have to throw one person from among them, so as to
 lighten the load. The Prophet had to
jump into the sea because his name came up
while drawing the lots. Excellent Amir. Now for the last question. How did the Prophet escape
from the whale’s stomach? The Prophet kept praying to God
while he was in the whale’s belly God saw the sincere
repentance of the Prophet, and He decided to save him! God then commanded the
whale to go the surface, and eject the Prophet
onto the shore. Masha Allah! You give all
the right answers today! I will tell you another
story tomorrow, Good night my son! Good night Baba!"
"Hmm..  why is Baba so late to
 come home today? Assalamu Alaikum! Wa-alaikum Assalam! Why are you late today? Oh, I just had to finish few
 works my son. So are you ready for the story
 of another Prophet? Yes baba! Insha Allah! I will tell you the story of
 Prophet Hud (as) tonight. Now listen carefully. Bismillah! After the great flood, the descendants of Prophet Nuh (as)
 populated the earth. Prophet Nuh (as) had 
many grandsons, and they had even
more grandsons! Like that the population of
 earth grew quickly. Many of them settled down
 in ancient Yemen. It is said that those who
settled down here were the descendants of Iram, one of the grandsons
of Prophet Nuh (as). They were called the Ad people The Ad people were
 big and strong, and they were very
 hardworking too!  They were known for
their craftsmanship, especially in the construction of
tall beautiful buildings. The people of AD grew rich, and they erected huge towers on top of
 every mountain nearby, to showcase their skills. They were very proud of what
they had become. At first, all of them were
 good muslims, and prayed to Allah (swt). But as time went by, they were misled by Shaitan The Ad people made idols
from the stone, and started worshipping
these idols! They ignored the Allah’s warnings, and worshipped these
 idols instead, and fell into bad ways. That was when Allah (swt)
decided to send  another Prophet to earth! This time Allah chose the
Prophet Hud (as) from among themselves, to warn them as a trusty adviser. “Allah has sent me to you” he said to his people. “He was the one who taught
 you everything. He gave you this world, he gave you your children, he gave you animals” “You should stop worshipping
 false gods. There is only one Allah (swt).  You should obey his commands”
 He told them. But the people of Ad shouted back
 at the Prophet “Who are you to advice us? Why should we listen to you? And they ignored the Prophet “I was chosen to convey
 God’s message”  He told them calmly. “Listen to what I say, if you do not, then I fear that God will
 punish you! The people didn’t listen and they said “You are nothing but a liar. Why should we listen to the
words of a liar? “I am not a liar” the
 Prophet told them And the Ad people said
“If you are not a liar, then prove what you are
 saying is true. Tell Allah to send the
punishment” Hud (as) was sad and disappointed
when he heard this. “I am not a liar,  I am the Prophet of Allah” he told them earnestly. But no one believed in him,
 and walked away The Prophet tried preaching to
different tribes as well. “Do you think the houses you have built is
going to last for ever? He asked them. “Remember that it is Allah who gave
 you your fortunes. He is my Lord, and
 your Lord,  and only in him should you trust. I have already warned
you before.  If you don’t obey Allah, He will choose some other people
to take your place. Allah knows and hears
everything! But the elders of the tribe
 too rejected him calling him a fool and a liar The Prophet tried again to
 convince them “O my people,
 I am not a fool” He told them. “I am a messenger from the
 Lord of the worlds. I am letting you know His will,  and give you my honest advice” They didn’t listen to the Prophet, and they too turned their
backs on him And they continued
worshipping the idols There were only a very
 few people in Ad, who listened to the words
 of the Prophet. Hud (as) realized that Allah was
 going to punish the people of Ad soon. Allah punishes the disbelievers,
 no matter how rich, tyrannical or great they are. In the next few days, a drought spread throughout
the land. The sky no longer sent its rain, and the sun scorched the
 desert sands. Ad people came to the
Prophet asking “Why is this drought Hud?” And the Prophet answered, “Allah is angry with you. If you believe in him, He will accept you and he will
send the rains.” “You are such a fool” they laughed at the Prophet, more obstinate and sarcastic. The drought increased, the trees turned yellow,
and the plants died. But the people continued to
worship the idols Many months went by, and Ad did not receive even
 a single rain drop. The Ad people refused to accept
 Allah as their god, and prayed to the idols for
 sending the rains. But the drought went on for
three long years! One day, when the Prophet was
offering his prayers, Allah (swt) asked the Prophet to gather
 his true companions, and told him to leave Ad. Shortly afterwards, a huge black cloud
appeared in the sky over the people of Ad!  The disbelievers didn’t realize
 that it was Allah who had sent that cloud as
warning to them. They thought that this large
 cloud was going to  give them the rains instead, and worshipped the idols again! The weather changed suddenly from
burning dry and hot, to stinging cold with the wind
that shook everything- Trees, Plants, Tents, Even
men and women! The wind increased
day after night, and night after night. The Ad people realized that this was the
 punishment sent by Allah, and began fleeing. They ran to their house to hide,  but the wind got stronger  and ripped their
 houses apart! The people then hid in
the basements of the huge buildings they
 had made, but the wind was so strong that the buildings collapsed, and the disbelievers died
in this basements The storm raged for eight days
and seven nights! The violent wind did not stop until
the entire region  was reduced to ruins! And all the wicked people in Ad
were now destroyed Only the Prophet Hud (as) and
his people were safe because they heeded the
 warnings of Allah (swt). They migrated to Hadramaut and
lived there in peace, worshipping Allah,
their true God. Masha Allah! That was such a
wonderful story I’m glad you liked it dear! Aren't you going to ask me
the questions today? Hahaa.. I was about to ask you that. Now are you ready? Yes Baba! Alright, now tell me where did the
 Prophet Hud (as) live? He lived in the land of ‘Ad That’s the right answer! Now for the next question, Tell me what sins did the
people of Ad commit? I’ll give you three options: A) Gambling B) Worshipping Idols
 C) Stealing Hmm.. It was option B!
Worshipping Idols! Thats right again!  You are doing very good! Thanks Baba Next question. For what skills were the people
 of Ad renowned for? Hmm.. Can you give me
some options? Of course, here they are.  Option A) Craftsmanship Option B) Singers Option C) Dancers Ha! They were renowned for
their craftsmanship That’s right again! Alright, now here is the next question. How did Allah (swt) punish the
people of Ad? Allah (swt) sent a drought to
 the land of Ad.  The people still mocked at
Prophet Hud (as). Then God send a strong wind that 
destroyed everything in Ad. Mashah Allah! That was 
excellent my son. Did Prophet Hud (as) 
die in the storm? No.. The Prophet and his followers
 remained unharmed! That’s right answer my son. Hmm..Its time for
 me to leave. I will tell you another
 story tomorrow. Which story are you going
 to tell me tomorrow? Insha Allah ! I think I will tell you the story of
 Prophet Saleh (as) tomorrow. Prophet Saleh (as)? Yes Amir.. After the destruction of Ad, the tribe of Thamur succeeded them. It was among them that 
this Prophet lived Wow! That sounds so interesting, I’m so excited! Alright.. Now go to sleep  Good night! Good night!"
"Assalamu Alaikum Walaikum Assalam Did you finish your homework
 today? Yes Baba, I did! So are you ready for the 
story of another prophet? I am always ready for the
 stories of prophet! Oh, is that so? Insha Allah, I will 
tell you  the story of Prophet Lut (as) today Bismillah! Prophet Ibrahim (as) left 
the city of Babylon along with his nephew Lut (as)
 and Sarah. They travelled for many days
 in the desert Prophet Lut then decided to go to 
the city of Sodom, which was on the western
 shore of the Dead Sea This city was filled with evil people. The people of the town were
 very wicked, and they attacked the travelers 
passing by. Another common evil among
the people of Sodom, was that the men had 
sex with men, instead of women they were all gay people!  No one had committed such
 sins ever before. This unnatural sin was later known 
as Sodomy, after the city  of Sodom. The people committed this sin without 
any shame in front of everyone. It was during the heights of
 crimes and sins that Allah (swt) sent his messenger
 Prophet Lut (as) to call the people back to him! The prophet summoned 
the people to give up their indecent behavior, but they were sunk way too
 deep in their sins that they were deaf to
 Prophets preaching. Lut then warned them of 
Allah’s punishment. But they then threatened
 to drive him out of the city, if he kept on preaching! The prophet was saddened when
 they continued their way of life. The news of the evil men in Sodom
 spread throughout the land. The prophet continued with his
 struggle to correct their ways. Years passed, and the prophet
 continued with his mission. No one responded to his call, except for the members of his family. And even in his family, not 
everyone listened to his words, and this included one of his wife! With very few people to 
believe in him, the prophet was tormented
 both inside and outside his home! His life was a continuous torture, and he suffered greatly,
 but the prophet remained patient and steadfast
 with his people. Years went by, 
 but no one was willing to listen to Him. They even mocked at him by saying “If what you are saying is true, then bring Allah’s punishment to us.” When the people refused 
to listen to him even after so many years, 
the prophet finally lost hope in them. And that’s when Allah decided
 to send the angels to destroy the evil people in Sodom. The angels took human form, and went to the house of  Ibrahim (as). Prophet Ibrahim and his wife 
Sarah were very old by now. He invited the angels to
 have food at his home, and the angels agreed. The prophet served 
roasted calf to the angels, but they didn’t touch the food at all! When Ibrahim noticed that they were
 not even touching the food, he started to worry, and he started
 fear them. The visitors then informed
 the prophet that they were actually angels
 sent by Allah (swt). They told him that Sarah will 
get pregnant soon, and that she will give birth to a child! The prophet and his wife were
 delighted to hear this news! The angels told the prophet that
 they should name their son Ishaaq, and that he would grow up to
 become a prophet as well. The angels then walked toward
 the city of Sodom. They reached the walls of 
the town in the afternoon. They then started walking
 toward the river. The first person who caught 
the sight of the angels was Lut’s daughter. She was sitting beside the
 river filling water in her jug. When she lifted her face
 and saw them, she was stunned! Never before
 had she seen such beautiful men in her whole life!! She couldn’t believe that such 
beauty even existed on earth! “Is there any place to rest?” 
asked one of the angels. “Stay here” she replied. She knew that if the evil men
 in her town saw them, they would try to harm these strangers. “Do not enter until I inform my father”
 She told them. She then left her jug beside the river
 and ran quickly to inform her father. “Oh father” she cried. There are three young and 
attractive men at the town gate. . I have never seen such 
beautiful faces before” The prophet got worried, 
and he ran to the town gate. The prophet did not recognize that
 they were actually angels as he thought they were
 travelers passing by. “Where did you come from” 
the prophet asked them  “And where are you going?” But they did not answer
 his question. Instead, they asked if they
 could stay at his house. Lut was in a dilemma now. He wanted to tell these strangers 
not to stay because of the evil people in the city,
 without offending them. Yet at the same time, 
he wanted to extend the hospitality shown to the guests. 
He tried several times to convince them, but they insisted on staying in the city. At last, he told them to wait 
outside the town gate till night, so that no one who would see them. When it became dark, Lut went to the gates and escorted
 the strangers to his home. As the prophet had planned, 
no one saw them. When they reached his house, the prophets wife saw them, 
and she slipped out of the house quietly. No one noticed her leaving the house. She ran to to her people and
 informed them about the beautiful strangers 
at her house. The news of the strangers 
spread like wildfire Everyone rushed to Lut’s house
 to see the strangers! Lut was surprised when he saw
 the people coming towards his house. He wondered how they got
 the news of the strangers. And when he noticed that his
 wife was missing, he realized that it was she who
 informed the people. The prophet was very sad 
that she cheated on them. When Lut saw the mob
 approaching his house, he immediately shut the door.  He pleaded with them to leave
 the strangers alone, He warned them of Allah’s punishment. The evil people of Sodom
 roared with laughter when they heard the Prophet’s words, and they broke down the door! Lut tried to defend his guests, but he stood powerless these 
violent people. He wished that he had the power 
to save his guests. When the angels saw the prophet
 in a state of despair, they revealed themselves 
to the prophet! “Do not be frightened! We are the angels, and these 
people will not harm you!” they said to the prophet. When the mob heard the angels, they fled from the prophet’s
 house terrified! They abused the prophet and
 ran to their homes. The angels then asked Lut to
 leave the town before sunrise. They asked him to take with
 him everyone, except the wife who cheated on him. Lut (as) left the city at dawn liked 
the angels asked him to. He took with him two of his daughters
 who were the only believers. When the morning came, Allah (swt) started the destruction of the most 
corrupted city on earth! At first he sent the earthquake
 that rocked the city down! It was as if a mighty power had lifted
 the entire city and flung it down in one jolt. And then he sent a storm of stones, 
that rained on the city! Everyone in the city was destroyed
 including the prophet’s wife. The town of Sodom was erased from
 the face of the earth, and no one survived except
 the prophet and his daughters! Lut (as) then went to see his uncle Ibrahim (as). He visited them and told him
 what happened in Sodom. But Ibrahim (as) already knew what
 had happened as the angels had informed
 him beforehand. Lut (as) continued to invite people 
to Allah, and so did Abraham (as)
 for a long long time. That was such an amazing story baba! Mashallah, I’m glad you liked it. I have a doubt. Go on.. ask me How was prophet Ibrahim (as) 
and Lut (as) related? Prophet Lut (as) was the nephew 
of Prophet Ibrahim (as) Oh.. Now I remember! Thank you! Alright.. Now are you ready
 for the questions? I am ready!
Ok, not tell me It was Sodomy! That’s the right answer, very good!
 Now for the next question. Who were the three strangers to
 visit the land of Sodom? They were the angels! Mashallah, that was so quick. Alright,
 now for the next question. When the angels arrived at the town
  gate, who was the first to see them? The angels were first seen 
by Prophet’s daughter! That’s right again! Why didn’t the prophet invite
 the strangers to his house right away? Why did he ask them to wait till night The strangers were very beautiful, 
and the prophet knew that if the evil people of Sodom saw them, 
they would hurt these strangers. That’s why he asked them
 to stay there till night Mashallah! That’s impressive Amir That’s brilliant my son. Now that’s 
all for today, I will tell you  the story of another prophet 
tomorrow.."
"Assalamu Alaikum! Waalaikum Assalam! Its story time again! SO excited huh? Yes Baba,  I really want to hear the story of
 Prophet Ishaq (as) today Hmm.. Not much is known about
Prophet Ishaq (as), so I will tell you all the known facts
 about this prophet, and I will also tell you the story 
of Prophet Yaqub (as),  who was his son Huh? Are you going to tell me the story 
of two prophets today? Hahaa.. Alright Alright, now sit down 
and listen carefully Bismillah! The Story of Prophet Ishaq (as) 
and Yaqub (as) Prophet Ibrahim (as) grew old, and so did his wife Sarah. One day when he was sitting 
outside his house,  he saw three men coming
 towards his house. The three men were actually angels
 sent by Allah (swt). The prophet welcomed them 
inside to have food. The strangers went in and 
sat down for food. Prophet served them a roasted calf! But the strangers did not touch 
the food at all. The prophet started to fear. Then the angels comforted the 
prophet and asked him not to fear at all. They told him that they were actually the
 angels sent by Allah (swt). They informed him that they
 came to his house  to deliver a good news. They said that Allah (swt) was going to
 give them a son, and that he should name him Ishaaq. They also told him that his son 
would be a prophet. Sarah could not believe her ears! “How could that be true”
 she wondered. “I am so old” Then the angels said that all things are
possible with Allah (swt). After a few months, Sarah got pregnant and gave
 birth to a child! The prophet named him Ishaaq,
 as the angels told him. Ishaq (as) grew up as an obedient boy. He worked hard, and like the angels foretold, he too became of prophet
 of Allah (swt). Ibrahim (as) was very old by the 
time Ishaq(as) grew up. As he felt that his life was
 nearing its end, he wished to see his
 son get married. But he did not want Ishaq(as) to marry
 one of the Caananites,  as they were all disbelievers One day, he sent one of his trustworthy
 servants to Haran  to choose a bride of Ishaq(as) The servant obeyed his master and 
travelled for many days to reach Haran Once he reached Haran,  the servant selected Rebekkah,  the daughter of Ibn Nahor, who was a brother of
 Prophet Ibrahim (as). And as his father wished, Ishaq(as) 
married Rebekkah Rebekkah didn’t give brith to a 
child for a long time. Ishaq (as) kept praying to
 Allah (swt) for a child, and after many years,  she gave brith to twins!  Ishaq(as) named them 
Esau and Yaqub! Esau grew upto be a strong man,  and he was a good hunter. But Yaqub was more intelligent  and he was his father’s favourite. There were frequent fights 
between the brothers as Esau disliked the fact that his father 
favoured Yaqub(as) more than him. Esau became more and more jealous
 as they grew! Ishaq(as) grew old, and he
 could not see clearly. One day he asked Esau to go hunting  and bring him some cooked meat. Rebekkah, his wife,  overheard the conversation and
 she ran to her son Yaqub(as)! Esau agreed and went
 hunting for the meat “Slaughter two goats of your best flock” 
she said to him “and cook them as you know
 your father will like. Go and do this before your
 brother returns” Yaqub(as) did as his mother had ordered. Rebekkah then asked him to put on
 his brothers clothes, and then she covered his hands and
 neck with goat's skin!  This was to make his skin feel like Esau, who was very hairy. Then Yaqub stepped into
 his father's room. “Who are you”
 asked Ishaq (as) “I am your son” replied Yaqub(as)
 in a deep voice. His father then started eating the food. Once he finished his food, he blessed Yaqub(as) to be 
the better brother and to be the leader of
 of his people! Once he got the blessings,
 he left the room. Esau returned with the
 meat after sometime, and he entered his father's room. “What is this my son?” The prophet asked when he heard 
Esau’s footsteps. “I’ve brought you the meat you like” Ishaq(as) was now confused. Didn’t you bring me the 
food an hour ago?” He asked him “I also gave you my blessings”. “No.. I swear I did not”
 Esau said. He then knew that he had been
cheated by Yaqub(as)! He felt so angry that he wanted to
 kill Yaqub right away! Rebekkah saw what had happened So she went to Yaqub(as) and ordered him 
to go to her brother Laban  in the land of Haran. She asked him to stay there until his
 brother was not angry at him anymore!. Yaqub (as) left his family and started his 
journey towards Haran. He travelled for many days
 in the desert. One evening, he got very tired of walking 
and decided to get some rest. He took a stone and put it under
 his head, and slept. That was when he had an
 amazing dream! In his dream, he saw a ladder from
 heaven to earth! He saw that the angels 
were coming down  and going up the ladder. It was then that Allah (swt)
 blessed Yaqub(as) and this piece of land for his 
future generations. When he woke up, he exploded with Joy!. He took a vow that if he returned
 to his family safely, he would build a mosque
 here for Allah (swt). He also vowed to give one tenth 
of his property to Allah (swt) He poured oil on that stone
 so that he would be  able to recognize this place later. This place is today known by the
 name of Jerusalem! The next morning, Yaqub(as)
 set out for Haran After many days of travelling, he finally reached Haran. Yaqub (as) then met his 
maternal uncle Laban. His uncle was very happy to see him,  and invited him to his house. Laban had two daughters- 
Leah and Rachel. The prophet started working 
hard for Laban. During his stay,  he fell in love with his uncle’s younger 
daughter Rachel After a few months, he asked Laban to marry Rachel. “Work for me for seven years”
 he said “and I will let you marry
my daughter”. The prophet agreed to his terms. Yaqub (as) worked hard and 
Laban prospered. After the end of the 
seventh year, his uncle prepared a feast and
 gathered people for the wedding. But his uncle tricked him, and he got his elder 
daughter Leah married to Yaqub (as). Leah was weak sighted and ugly. Yaqub(as) didn’t know about this,  and he discovered the truth
 only in the morning!! When he realized that he
 had been tricked,  he went to his uncle “You deceived me.” He said to Laban. “I was engaged to Rachel, and you married me to Leah?” His uncle said “it is not our tradition to marry 
the younger daughter before the elder one. “However”
 he added “If you love Rachel, work for another seven years and
 I will let you marry her” Yaqub (as) worked hard for 
another seven years and then married Rachel. It was acceptable in their time, as described in Torah, for a man to marry two sisters. Laban gave a female slave 
to each daughter. Leah’s slave was called Zilpah, and Rachel’s slave was
 called Bilha. What happened then? I will tell you the remaining 
story tomorrow. Oh no! Please tell me now Baba!
 Please please Come on.. It’s time for
 you to go to sleep. I will ask you a few questions now, and I’ll tell you rest of the 
story tomorrow Alright Baba Are you ready for the question? Yes! Why did the three angels come to the
 house of Prophet Ibrahim (as)? They came to deliver the news that
 they were going to have a son! Masha Allah! That’s the
 correct answer What was the name of the wife 
of Prophet Ishaq(as)? I know that..
 It was Rebekkah! That’s right again! What were the names of
 Prophet Ishaq’s sons? It was Esau… and..and..Yaqub! That’s right again! Now tell me why Esau
 hated Yaqub (as)? Hmm.. Esau hated him because he was
 his fathers favourite son, and also that God chose him
 as the next prophet That’s correct What was the name of Yaqub’s
 uncle in Haran? Hmm.. Wasn’t it Laban? That’s correct again! How long did Yaqub work for Laban? First he worked for seven years, and then he worked for
 another seven years Its 14, the prophet worked 
for 14 years for Laban What were the names of the 
daughters of Laban? They were Leah and Rachel! Masha Allah, you gave all the
 right answers. That’s all for today, I will tell you the story of another
 prophet tomorrow."
"Assalamu Alaikum! Wa alaikum Assalam Baba ! What were you doing Amir? I was just reading this
book on Prophets Hmm.. Can I see that? Of course.. here Hmm.. Stories of Prophets!
Masha allah! Baba, can you tell me the story of
Prophet Saleh (as) today? Hahaa.. I can see that you are getting very interested in the
 Prophet Stories! I am learning a lot from
 your stories, Thank you so much baba! Hmm..Alright..  I will tell you  the story of
Prophet Saleh (as) today. Now listen carefully. Bismillah! The story of Prophet Saleh (as) Allah had destructed the
city of Ad  because of their
wrongdoings. The tribe of Thamud succeeded them
 in power and glory! The people of Thamud, like the people of Ad were
 hardworking and excellent craftsmen! Like their forefathers, they too made buildings on the
 top of  mountains, and they lived in
 beautiful houses. Their lands were fertile, and it gave them abundant
crops as well! But as their material
wealth increased, so did their evil ways! The tribe was ungrateful
 to Allah (swt). And its members did not
 worship Him! The rich and the luxurious
became tyrants. The members of the
tribe worshipped  the idols instead. Prophet Saleh (as) lived during
that period of time. He was a good and
 wise person. The people loved him and
 respected him for his amazing qualities. Like their forefathers, idol worshipping was rooted deep in the
 hearts of men and women. The Prophet realized this, and he tried to correct them. He knew that even the tribe
chiefs were corrupt, and bad men. They practiced idol worshipping, and encouraged everyone 
to do so. They even punished those who
worshipped Allah (swt) However Saleh (as) was chosen as
 the Allah’s messenger. He was not afraid of anyone
 except Allah, the great and almighty. He prayed to Allah without
 fearing anyone. “O people! Worship Allah! You have no other
God but him” The Prophet said to them But the people of tribe
 said to him, “Oh Saleh! We always
 liked you, and we thought one day you would
 become our chief! Now why are you asking us
to worship Allah? How can you ask us to leave our
 Gods and worship yours. How can we forget our gods who were
 worshipped even by our fathers? We do not believe in your God. Go away.. They replied back It was from here that the struggle
 between the good and the evil began. The Prophet belileved in Allah,  and struggled against
the disbelievers. One day, as usual the
members of the tribe gathered around a huge rock on the
 top of the mountain. They worshipped the rock
for a long time, and when the children
saw their fathers, they started worshipping
the rock as well The people butchered rams as
sacrifice to the rock, and sought its blessings. When the Prophet saw this, he was sad and said to them “O my people. 
Please serve Allah, the one and only true God.” Then one of them said, “Why do you ask us to pray
to Allah alone? “Because he has created you”
said the Prophet “He gave you everything, the sun, the moon, the mountains,
the seas.. everything that you
see around!” Then one of the chiefs came
forward and said “Show us a miracle!”
 he said. “Show us a miracle and
 we’ll believe you” Then another chief came forward and said pointing at the rock “Ask your Lord to make a living she-camel
out of that rock” Then another chief forward and said “Yes! The camel should be
 pregnant too!  Ha haa” He laughed The Prophet thought for a
 while and replied “If Allah delivers this miracle, Do you promise to believe in Allah
as the one true god? Will you accept that
 I’m his apostle?” “Yes” they answered. The Prophet then prayed to Allah to grant
 them their request. It was a miracle!! At first the people heard the sound of
 rocks breaking apart Then suddenly the rock fell apart, and there it was, A beautiful She-Camel!! It was huge and it was
pregnant too!! When people saw
 the she-camel, they were amazed! They couldn’t believe
 their eyes! Some people believed what they
just saw instantly, but some, especially the rich
and the powerful, thought that this
 was magic. The Prophet prostrated before
 the camel, as it was Allah who brought
the she camel  out of the rock with his glory! Few other people prostrated before
 the camel as well, as they now believed in the
 power of Allah They had seen a great sign
 before their eyes. “What the Prophet said was true”
They said. “Allah is the true god” But even now, the number of
 believers were very few. The others mind was still corrupted, and refused to believe
 in Allah (swt) The she camel became the symbol for 
Saleh (as) message. It became the symbol of 
 Allah (swt) After three days, the she camel gave birth to a
 lovely young he-camel. The young camel always 
followed his mother. It stayed behind its
 mother calmly, and she looked after
 son fondly. Very soon, the she camel and her son became symbols for affection
 and mercy. When the people of the tribe saw it, they said “This is saleh’s
 she-camel’ Then the Prophet
 said to his people “O my people, 
worship Allah. There is no  God but him. This is a clear sign from your Lord. This she camel is a sign for you. So leave her to graze 
on Allah’s earth. Be careful not to hurt it. If you do that, then Allah 
will punish you. Days passed,  and the she camel grazed in the green pastures 
of Thamud. It ate the plants from
 the valley, and drank water
 from the well. The she camel was so huge that it drank lots and
 lots of water. And while it was drinking water
 from the well, no other animal or people could
 go near the well. The she camel nursed the
 newborn fondly. She gave him her milk. When the people of Thamud
 saw the milk, their mouths watered. They hurried to the Prophet. “The camel's milk may
 be blessed!” they said to him. “The baby camel is not going
 to have all of it, so please let us have some of
 the she camel’s milk” they requested. The Prophet thought for a while, and he said that they were allowed
 to have the milk  of the camel, by Allah’s grace. However he asked them to share 
the water with the camel.  He told them that one day they could have the milk 
of the camel, while she drank water
 from the well. And on the second day, he told them to leave the milk 
for her child. The people agreed to the 
Prophets suggestion. The camel gave plenty of milk  and it covered the needs of the
 entire Thamud! At first, the people were 
happy and content. But soon, the disbelievers started
 raising their voices. They hated the Prophet for turning
 people away from their idols. And their hatred now
 turned towards the blessed she camel! The tribe of Thamud was divided 
into two parts now. First was the muslims who believed in
 Allah and his Prophet, and the second were the
 disbelievers who thought  the Prophet was lying. The disbelievers mocked
 at the muslims. They mocked at their beliefs. “Do you believe that Saleh is 
the Prophet of God? “Yes we believe in his message”
 they answered. “We believe Allah is
 the true god. But the disbelievers openly 
denied Allah (swt). They were the rich and powerful
 men of Thamud Some of the chiefs were against
 the Prophet too! They knew that the Prophet was a 
danger to their beliefs. One night, these evil men
 gathered together and hatched a plot to kill the
 poor she camel! They took the help of their wives to
 convince nine strong men. These nine men agreed to kill the 
she camel and her calf! Next day, they kept watching
 the camel closely, observing all its 
movements. As the she camel came to the 
drink water at the well, one of the men shot its
 leg with an arrow!! The camel cried out loudly, and it started to run. But the poor animal couldn’t because  of the arrow stuck on its leg Then the others followed the camel,  and struck it with a sword 
on the other leg! The poor animal fell
 down crying. All of them used their swords to
 pierce the animal,  and finally it was dead! The killers were given a 
hero’s welcome, cheered with songs and poetry. The disbelievers jumped up
 and down with joy, for they had succeeded in
 killing the gift of Allah! The Prophet was heartbroken to see
 the poor she camel dead. “ENJOY LIFE FOR THREE MORE DAYS, FOR THE GOD IS SENDING
 HIS PUNISHMENT” He shouted to the evil men who 
were dancing with joy “ “Why three days?” 
They asked. “Let the punishment come as
 quickly as possible” they said arrogantly. The Prophet once again tried
 pleading with them “My people, why do you
 follow the evil ways? Seek forgiveness from Allah so that  you may receive his mercy” But they didn’t listen to him and continued their 
celebrations The evil men then plotted to 
kill the Prophet as well. But Allah saves the Prophet and his followers from
 their wicked plans . Heavy hearted, they left 
the land of evildoers and moved to another place. And the day for the
 punishment arrived as the Prophet had warned. The disbelievers stayed inside their
 homes made of rock, feeling safe. Suddenly thunderbolts appeared 
out of nowhere, and there were severe 
earthquakes as well! The land was violently
 shaken, killing every man and animal
 living in Thamud. Neither their strong buildings, nor their stone houses 
could protect them. All the disbelievers in Thamud 
were struck dead at the same time. Everything in Thamud 
was destroyed before  people could even realize
 what was going on! Only the people who 
believed in Allah (swt) were saved because they
 had left the place. The arrogance and 
disbelief of the people  could not save their lives, nor could their idols. Their large and extravagant
 buildings could offer no 
protection at all! God continues to send
 clear guidance, but disbelievers choose
to ignore them. Allah (swt) is the most merciful 
and the most forgiving. However, we should not
 ignore God’s warnings. God’s punishments, as the people of 
Thamud experienced can be swift and severe. Masha allah! That was such a
 great story! I’m glad you liked it! Now the questions baba? Hahaa.. You are right.
 Are you ready? Yes! What sins did the people
 of Thamud commit? The people of Thamud were
 Idol worshippers! Isn't that right Baba? That’s the correct answer! Now tell me, how did the
 people of Thamud challenge the Prophet, to make them believe
 in Allah (swt)? They asked the Prophet to
 perform a miracle! And can you tell me what 
that miracle was? They asked him to make
 a living camel out of the rock they worshipped. And they also wanted the
 camel to be pregnant! Was the Prophet able to
 perform this miracle? Yes! When the Prophet 
prayed to Allah (swt),  a huge she camel emerged
 from the rocks, and she was pregnant too! Mash allah! 
That’s very good!  Now for the next question, What did the people of 
Thamud complain about? Let me give you three options
 to choose from. Option A- The Camel was
 very naughty. Option B- The camel 
ate their sheeps. Or, Option C- The camel drank all
 the water from the well Hmmm.. It was Option C! That’s correct again! The camel was so huge that it drank a lot of water The next question- How did God punish the 
people of Thamud? Allah (swt) sent huge earthquakes and thunderbolts to destroy
 the people of Thamud That’s right again! Thanks Baba I’ll come back tomorrow, and tell you the story of
 Prophet Ibrahim (as) Thank you Baba!"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum As-salam Baba! Are you ready for today’s story? Yes! That’s great! Inshallah, I’m goint to tell you the
story of Prophet Musa(as) today! Who was he Baba? Prophet Musa (as) is
considered a Prophet, Messenger, and a
Leader in Islam. He is the most frequently mention
individual in the Quran. The Quran states that the Prophet was
sent by God to the Pharaoh of Egypt and the Israelites for
guidance and warning Wow! Please tell me the story! Alright, now listen carefully Bismillah! The Story of Prophet Musa (as) Prophet Musa (as)
grew up as a Prince! The Pharaoh’s who ruled over Egypt  were very cruel towards the
 descendants of Yaqub (as). The descendants were known
as the children of Israel. They were kept as slaves and
forced to work for small wages, and sometimes even for nothing! The Pharaoh wanted the
Israelites to obey only him, and worship only his Gods! This way many dynasties came to Egypt,
and they assumed that they were Gods, or their representative
spokesmen. Years passed, and a very cruel man
named Phir’oun was the Pharaoh now. He hated the Israelites very much. He punished the Israelites
at every given opportunity. He hated to see them multiplying
and prospering in his kingdom. One night when the Pharaoh was sleeping,
he had a dream! In his dream, he saw that a huge ball
 of fire came from the sky, and burned down the city. The fire burned the
houses of all Egyptians, but the houses of
Israelites stayed unharmed! The Pharaoh was horrified! He didn’t understand
what the dream meant, so the next day… he called his priests
and magicians. He asked them about
the dream he had. The priests said to him “This means that a boy will be
born to the Israelites very soon. Egyptians are going to perish
at the hands of this boy!” The Pharaoh got very angry! He ordered to kill every male
child born to the Israelites! Pharaoh’s order was carried out, and the soldiers began to kill every
male child born to the Israelites! It was during at that time that
Prophet Musa (as) was born.  The Prophet was born to a poor]
 Israelite family, and he had an elder brother
named Haroon (as), and another sister. Allah (swt) had a
plan for the Prophet. He ordered his mother to
place him in a basket, and allow it to float downstream
in the great Nile river! Musa (as)’s mother did as she
was told, and as she let him float in the river. Her heart grieved for her son! However, she was aware that
Allah(swt) cared for her son, and she knew that no
harm will come to him. As the basket floated away, she asked her daughter to follow the
 basket downstream, and make sure that no harm
came to her son. The basket floated in the
river for a long time, and the Prophet’s sister followed the
basket as her mother had instructed. Allah(swt) was guiding the basket, and after floating on
river Nile for sometime, the basket entered
a small stream The Pharaoh’s wife was
bathing in that stream, and when she saw the basket, she asked her servants
to bring it ashore. When she saw the baby, she just fell in love with him. Pharaoh’s wife was very
different from the Pharaoh. She was a believer, and she was also merciful. She was longing for a child, so when she saw the baby, she hugged and kissed him. Pharaoh was surprised when he saw his
wife hugging and kissing the baby. He was astonished as he saw her weeping
with joy, which he had never seen before! “Let me keep this baby, and
let him be a son to us” she requested her husband. The Pharaoh couldn’t refuse her, and they decided
to adopt the baby. After sometime, the baby
started getting hungry and he started crying The queen summoned a few wet nurses
to feed the baby, but he refused to take any of
 their breast milk. It was then that the soldiers
brought the sister to the queen “This girl was following
the basket” they told her Then the sister replied “I was just following the basket
out of curiosity, your highness” When she saw her brother crying, she was worried and
she blurted out “I know someone
who can feed him” The queen agreed, and she ordered
the soldiers to fetch the woman, that the little girl
was talking about. The prophet’s sister then
brought their mother, and she started to feed him. As the child was
put to her breast, he immediately started
suckling the milk. The Pharaoh, who was watching all this,
was astonished,  and asked “Who are you? This child has refused to take
any other breast, but yours?” The mother of the Prophet knew
that if she told them the truth, they would kill
them immediately. So she told them “I am a woman
of sweet milk, and sweet smell. That’s why no child refuses me” Her answer satisfied
the Pharaoh, and she was appointed
as his nurse. Musa (as) grew up in the
palace as a prince. Allah(swt) granted him good health,
strength, knowledge and wisdom! He had a kind heart, so the weak and the
oppressed often turned to him seeking help One day, while he was
walking in the city, he saw an Egyptian soldier
beating an Israelite. When the Israelite
saw the Prophet, he begged him for his help. The Prophet decided
to help the poor man, and asked the soldier to
stop beating the Israelite. The soldier questioned
his authority, and said something that
really angered the Prophet. The Prophet first tried to
reason with the soldier, but he was not
willing to listen. Then the Prophet stepped forward and hit
the soldier with such a powerful blow, that he collapsed and died! When he realized
what he had done, a cold sweat broke out
from his forehead He said to himself “This is the evil work of Shaitan. He misled me” The Prophet knew that it
was a sin to kill anyone until he is brought to
trial and found guilty. He knelt on the ground
and prayed to Allah(swt) “O my Lord! I I have
indeed wronged my soul. Please forgive me” The next day he saw the same
Israelite fighting with another man. The Prophet helped the
weaker one, and said “You seem to be involved in fights
everyday with one or the other” The Israelite got
scared and said “I’m so sorry. Please don’t kill me like
how your killed the soldier yesterday” The Egyptian with whom the Israelite was
fighting, overheard the remarks, and he reported this
to the authorities. The next day, when Musa (as)
was walking in the city, a man came running to him “Musa! The soldiers are
coming to arrest you! Get away while there is
still time!” said the man The Prophet knew that the penalty
for killing an Egyptian was death. So he decided to leave Egypt. The Prophet left Egypt in a hurry, so he didn’t even bother to change
 his clothes.  He was not prepared for travelling , so he didn’t have
an animal to ride, nor did he have a caravan. He had left as soon
as the man warned him Mashallah! That was
such a wonderful story! I’m glad you like it my son! Yes, I am! Alright. Now tell me why did the Pharaoh order to kill every male child
 born to the Israelites? Hmm.. He did so because
his priests warned him. They told him that a child would be
born to the Israelites, and that all Egyptians would perish at
 the hands of the boy! Mashallah! That was right Now tell me how the
Prophet’s mother saved him? Allah(swt) commanded her to place
her baby in a basket, and let the basket
float on river nile! And can you tell me
who found the basket The Queen found the basket, and
she adopted the boy as her son! That’s great! Now tell me why
the Prophet had to leave Egypt The Prophet while trying
to save an Israelite, killed an Egyptian soldier. When the authorities came to arrest
him, the Prophet left the country That was brilliant!! Now that’s all for today, I will
tell you another story tomorrow Good night my son! Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum As-salam! Have you finished your
 homework Amir? Yes Baba! That’s great! So are you ready for
the story of Prophet Musa (as)? Yes baba! I really want to know
what happened to him in the desert! Alright!
Now listen carefully! Bismillah Prophet Musa (as) Hears
the Voice of God!! Prophet Musa (as) wandered in the
desert for many days and nights! He travelled in the
direction of Midian, which was the nearest town
between Syria and Egypt. His only companion in the
desert was Allah (swt), and his only provision was piety. The hot sand burned the
soles of his feet, but fearing pursuit
by the soldiers, he forced himself to keep walking. Like this, He walked for
eight days and nights. The Prophet finally managed
to cross the desert, and he reached the
outskirts of Midian. After walking for some more time, he
reached a watering hole outside the city. As soon as he
reached the spring, he threw himself under a
tree to rest for sometime. As he caught his breath, he noticed two women standing
aside with their sheep. They were standing far away, hesitant to approach the crowd The Prophet sensed that
the women needed help. So being a man of honor,
he ignored his thirst, and went to them. “Can I help you in any way? Why are you standing
aside?” He asked them Then the older sister replied “We are waiting until the men
finish watering their sheep. “Why are you waiting”
He asked them again “We are helpless”
they said. “Our father is very old, and he doesn’t have the
strength to face this crowd . If we go forward, these strong
men will push us aside.. So when these people
are finished, then we take our
animals to the water. Its our daily routine”
they explained. The Prophet took the women’s sheep
 to the waterhole, where he easily pushed in
 amongst the men. When He approached the water, he saw that the shepherds had put
a large rock to cover the well. The Prophet single handedly
lifted the rock, and he let the animals drink. The people standing there were
 awestruck when they saw him lifting the stone
with just one hand!! He then returned to sit
in the shade of the tree. That’s when He realized that
he had forgotten to drink! “O Lord” He prayed, “Whatever
good you can bestow on me, I am surely in need of it now. When the daughters returned home
 earlier than usual,  their father was surprised! The daughters then explained what happened
at the oasis, and why they reached early. Their father wanted to
thank the stranger, so he sent one of his daughters to
invite the stranger to his home! One of the daughters returned
to the Prophet and told him “My father wants to reward
you for your kindness, and He invites you to our home” He agreed, and accompanied
the maiden to her father. When they reached the house, the Prophet introduced himself, and
told him the story of his life. He then told them why He
had to flee from Egypt. The Old man comforted Him “Be grateful to Allah(swt) that you have
managed to escape from those tyrants! You need not be afraid now!” The Old man and his daughters really liked
the gentle behavior of the Prophet. They invited him to stay
with them for a few days, and the Prophet was more than
happy to accept their invitation. The hosts soon realized that the
Prophet was a trustworthy man. One day, the Old man
approached Him and said “I wish to marry you to
one of my daughters” The Prophet was
happy to hear this “But on one condition”
the old man added. “You must agree to work for me for
a period of eight years” He said The Prophet was a stranger
in a strange land. Exhausted and alone, this
offer suited Him very much. He married the Midianite’s daughter and
looked after his animals for ten long years! Time passed, and he stayed far away
from his family and his people. This period of ten years, was
very important for the Prophet. It was a time for major preparation. Musa (as) completed ten years
of service as He had promised. One day, suddenly He was
overcome by homesickness. He started missing his family
and the Land of Egypt! He desperately wanted
to return to Egypt. That night he went
to His wife and said “We shall leave for
Egypt tomorrow” His wife agreed and they started
packing their belongings. Musa (as) left Midian with his family
and travelled through the desert. They traveled for many days, and
finally reached near Mount Sinai. “I think we have lost our
way” said the Prophet. The Prophet was confused, so He
decided to camp there for the night. He then left searching for
firewood to light up a fire. He kept searching, and
reached Mount Tur. As He walked, he noticed a fire
burning on the top of the mountain! Musa (as) walked
towards the fire, and as he did, he heard a voice! “O Musa, I am Allah, the Lord
of the Universe” said the voice The Prophet realized that it
was indeed God talking to Him, and so he walked
towards the fire. Allah,then asked the Prophet to remove his
shoes as he was standing on a Holy Ground God then revealed to Him that He had
been chosen for a special mission, and asked Him to follow
His instructions. “And what is it in your right hands?”
Allah(swt) asked Him “This is my staff”
He replied “on which I lean, and with which I
beat down the branches for my sheep” “Throw down your staff”
the voice commanded. And no sooner did the Prophet
throw down the staff, that it turned into
a wriggling snake! Musa (as) was frightened,
and he started to run!! But the voice said
“Fear not and grasp your stick, we shall return it
to its former state” The Prophet was terrified
 of the snake. He then trusted the Voice, and
placed His hand over the snake. It immediately transformed
back into his staff again!! The fear of Musa (as) subsided and
 was replaced by peace, as he realized that he was indeed
 talking to God. Next, Allah(swt) commanded him to
put his hand inside the robe. The Prophet did as commanded, and
when he pulled his hand out, it was shining brilliantly! Allah(swt) then commanded him to go
to Egypt, and face the Pharaoh. He told him that the Pharaoh
had become arrogant, and was suppressing
the Israelites. Musa (as) feared that he would be arrested
if He returned to Egypt, so he said “O Allah! I have killed a man among
them, and I fear they will kill me!” Then Allah (swt) comforted
 him by saying “Go and deliver this
message to them. Show them the path of the truth. Take your brother
Haroon, to assist you. They will not be able to harm
you at all” Allah(swt) assured him of his safety,
and the Prophet was convinced. What happened next? I will tell you that tomorrow! Mashallah! That was such a great story! Now are you ready
for the questions? Yes Baba! Alright, now tell me why did
the Prophet escape from Egypt? The Prophet had killed an Egyptian, and
that’s why he had to flee from Egypt That’s right! How did the Prophet find a
place to stay in Midian? The Prophet helped the daughters of
an Old Midianite to fetch water. That’s why the family gave
him food and shelter. How long did Prophet Musa (as)
 stay in Midian? 8 years! No wait, it was 10 years!!
Isnt that right? That’s correct my son! Now tell me the name of the mountain where
the Prophet found the burning flame? It was Mount Tur!! Mashallah! That was
excellent my son. I’ll see you again tomorrow.
Good night! Good night baba! Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum- Assalam! Did the Prophet go to Egypt Baba? What happened then? You look so excited! Please tell me the rest
of the story Baba! Inshallah! I will tell you story of how
Prophet Musa (as) confronted the Pharaoh. Are you ready? Yes! Bismillah! The Story of Musa (as) in Egypt! In the last episode, we saw how Allah
(swt) ordered Musa (as) to go to Egypt, for delivering his message. The Prophet, then took His family and
set off in the direction of Egypt. They walked for many days, and
finally they arrived in Egypt. When they reached outside the city, his brother- Haroon (as),
was waiting for him! Haroon (as) was a
Prophet as well. He had received a
vision from God, and in the vision He had seen that His
younger brother would soon arrive, to set the Israelites free! When Musa (as) realized
that this was his brother, he was in tears!! Then Both of them walked
toward the Palace. The Prophet had not been
to Egypt for many years, and He knew that His
life was in danger. Nothing could have brought Him back
except the command of Allah (swt). Prophet could still hear the words
of Allah(swt) ringing in his ears “Go to the Pharoah and tell him to let
the Israelites leave the land of Egypt” Musa (as) now stood in front of the
Pharaoh along with his brother. The Prophet spoke to the Pharaoh
about Allah and His mercy. But the Pharaoh refused to listen
because he considered himself as a God! He listened to the Prophet’s
speech with disdain. He thought the Prophet was crazy
to question his supreme position. After the prophet finished delivering
 Allah’s message, the Pharaoh raised his hand and asked “What do you want?” “I want you to send the children of
Israel with us” answered the Prophet “The Israelites are my slaves, why
should I send them with you?” “They are not your slaves, they
are the slaves of Allah (swt)” This answer angered the Pharaoh. “Are you not Musa?” The Prophet shook his
head, and answered Yes “We picked you up from river Nile,
 and brought you up, didn’t we” asked the Pharaoh. “Are you not  Musa, who
killed an Egyptian man? You are a fugitive of justice and
how dare you come and speak to me?” The Prophet ignored his sarcasm, and explained that he killed the
Egyptian in an accident,  it was never deliberate. He then informed the Pharaoh that
Allah(swt) had granted him forgiveness, and that He was now one
of his messengers. The Pharaoh asked Musa (as) to show a sign
to prove that he was the messenger of God. The Prophet threw his
stick to the floor, and it turned into a serpent!! It started slithering and
sliding along the floor! The Pharaoh was
terrified at first, but he tried hard
not to show it. “Ha!” said the
Pharaoh arrogantly, “we have many sorcerers in our
kingdom who can match your magic! The Pharaoh detained the Prophet
and His brother at the Palace. He then summoned all the magicians
in his kingdom to the palace. The Pharaoh promised huge rewards to them  if their magic was found better
 than the Prophet’s. The day for the contest arrived, and
the palace was crowded with people. The magicians stood on one side  and the Prophet
and His brother stood opposite to them. Everyone in the palace
took the side of Pharaoh, and the Prophet and His
brother stood alone. Musa (as) asked the
magicians to perform first. It is said that there were more than
seventy magicians lined up in a row!. The magicians threw their sticks and ropes, and suddenly the ground floor was
flooded with a sea of serpents! They were writhing and
slithering everywhere! The crowd was amazed
when they saw this, and they thought the Prophet was never
going to beat such powerful magic. Musa (as) was afraid too, but he
knew that God was on His side. The Prophet threw his stick
to the floor, and suddenly it transformed into
a huge serpent!! The serpent then ate all other
small ones lying on the ground!! When the crowd saw this, they stood up
like a wave, cheering for the Prophet! The magicians were
surprised as well! They knew that this
was not just a trick, and that the serpent was real! They realized that Musa was not
just a magician or a sorcerer The magicians knew that Musa’s
power came from something greater, so they fell on their knees
seeking forgiveness from Allah(swt). Allah(swt)  forgave them, but
the Pharaoh grew furious. “How can you believe in his God,
before I gave you my permission?” He asked them angrily But the magicians replied “Do what you wish,  but we fear the punishment of Allah(swt)
 much more than you” The Pharaoh got angry
when he heard this. He now realized that
he had a problem, as the Prophet kept asking
him to free the Israelites. His kingdom was built on the
fear of the Israelites, and everyone believed
him to be the God. He was now worried that his kingdom
was about to be unraveled. The Pharaoh felt threatened, and he summoned all the ministers,
 leaders for a serious meeting. “Am I a liar, O Haman?” He opened
the session with this question Haman stood up, and asked “Who
dared to accuse you of lying?” “Didn’t Musa say that there
is a Lord in Heaven?” “Musa is lying” said Haman. The Pharaoh then ordered to kill
 and torture all those who followed the Prophet! The soldiers then started
torturing the Israelites. They slayed the men, and not
even the babies were spared. They imprisoned anyone who
dared to oppose them. The Prophet stood watching their
 horrific acts helplessly. He asked the people to be patient, and asked them to have faith in Allah (swt) God commanded Musa (as) to warn the Pharaoh
that he and the Egyptians would suffer a severe punishment if the children
of Israel were not set free. The Prophet agreed, and went
to meet the Pharaoh again! He then made another demand to release
the Israelites, But the Pharaoh refused. It was then that God afflicted Egypt
with a severe drought.  Even the lush, green and
fertile valleys of Nile began to wither and die. The crops failed, and the
animals began to die. Even as the Egyptians suffered
 because of the famine, the Pharaoh refused to obey,
 and he remained arrogant. Then God sent a huge flood to
devastate the Land of Egypt! Villages were drowned, the crops were
destroyed and many Egyptians were killed! Then the people, including the
chief ministers appealed to Musa “Musa” they cried “Please help us. We shall believe in you and your God,
if you remove this punishment from us! We shall let the children of Israel
 go with you! The Prophet then prayed to God,
and the Land returned to normal. The land became fertile,
and the crops grew again! But the children of Israel
were still enslaved! They were not allowed
to leave as promised! The Prophet asked them to
fulfill their promise, but they paid no heed to his request. They ignored him and walked away He prayed to God again, and this time
Allah(swt) sent plagues of locusts to Egypt The locusts attacked the crops, and
swallowed everything in their path! The people rushed to the Prophet
 begging for his help. The ministers promised to let go
of the Israelites,  if he would send the locusts away The Prophet prayed to God again,
and the locusts departed. But even now, they didn’t let the
Israelites leave as they promised. God then sent a plague of lice,
spreading disease among the Egyptians. It was followed by a plague of frogs
that harassed and terrified the people The people rushed to the Prophet begging to
save them, every time God sent his punishments. They promised to free the
Israelites every time, but when God withdrew
the punishments, they refused to let go of them. Then the last sign- the
sign of blood was revealed. The water of the River
Nile turned into blood! The water appeared normal when the
Israelites drank from the river. However, if any Egyptian filled his cup
with water, the water turned into blood. They hurried to the Prophet as usual, and as soon as everything
returned to normal, they turned their backs on Allah(swt) Masha Allah!
That was such a wonderful story!! Now are you ready for the questions? Yes, I am! Alright, now tell me why did
Prophet Musa (as) return to Egypt? I know that one! God commanded the Prophet to go back
to Egypt for freeing the Israelites! That’s correct! Now tell me what were the punishments
sent by Allah(swt) in order First God sent a severe drought That’s right.. then? Then He sent a devastating flood.. Then he sent a plague of locusts
 followed by lices and frogs Excellent! And what was
the final punishment? As a final punishment, God
turned Nile water into blood! Masha Allah!
 That was excellent! Alright, now its time for me to leave, I will tell you another
story tomorrow! Good night son! Good night baba! Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum- Assalam! How are you Amir? I’m fine Baba.. Will you tell me the
remaining story today? Of course I will tell you the
remaining story of Prophet Musa (as). Now where did we stop yesterday? You told me till how God sent the
final sign to the people of Egypt. And what was that? It was the sign of blood! God turned Nile water into blood! That’s very good! Inshallah! I will
start from there… Listen carefully! Bismillah The Story of Exodus! The Egyptians refused to believe in Allah,
 inspite of the miracles that Musa (as) performed. God sent his punishments
repeatedly, and the people would appeal to Musa (as),
 promising to release Israelites. But time and again, they
broke their promises Finally, God withdrew His mercy,  and gave order for Musa to lead his people
 out of Egypt. The people carried their jewels and
their other belongings with them. This mass migration was
later known as Exodus. In the darkness of the night, the Prophet
led his people towards the Red Sea. By now, Pharaoh realized that the
Israelites had left the city. He got really angry, and he assembled an
army to follow and capture the Israelites. By early morning, the Israelites
had reached the Red Sea. When the Prophet looked back, He could
see the army getting closer and closer. He realized that they were
soon going to get trapped. In front of them was the Red Sea, and
to their back was Pharaoh’s army! Fear and panic began to
spread through the people! Musa (as) walked towards the edge of the
Red Sea and looked out at the horizon. It was then that Yusha(as)
turned to the Prophet and asked “In front of us is this
impassable barrier- the sea! And our enemy is
approaching from behind! Surely, death cannot be avoided! But the Prophet did not panic. He stood silently and waited for God
to keep his promise-  to free the children of Israel! At that moment Allah(swt) commanded the
 Prophet to strike the sea with His staff! Musa (as) did as
he was commanded. A fierce wind began to blow, the sea began to swirl and spin! And suddenly, the sea parted revealing
a path for people to walk!! It was a miracle!! The Prophet then led his
people across the sea. As they walked, the waves stood
like a mountain on each side! The Prophet ensured that
everyone crossed the sea safely. When He looked back, He could see the
pharaoh and his men approaching. The Pharaoh and his army had
seen this miracle as well. But the Pharaoh was a pretender. He wanted to take the credit for this
miracle, so he shouted to his men “Look! The sea has opened at my
command, so that we may arrest them” They rushed across the parted
waters following the Israelites. But when they reached midway, the water came crashing on them! Pharaoh realized that
he was going to die. He shouted out of fear “I believe that
there is no God other than Allah, and I surrender to You” But it was too late. The curtain fell on the
Pharaoh’s tyranny, and the waves carried
his body to the shore. When the Egyptians
saw his dead body, they realized that the man they
 had worshipped could not even keep away his own death! They now knew that
he was never a god! God had favored the children of Israel,
and he led them safely out of Egypt. After a few days of walking in
the desert, they got thirsty. God then commanded the Prophet
to strike a rock with his staff! It was a miracle! There came twelve different
springs of water from the rock! Each spring was meant for
twelve different tribes, God did this so that there won’t be
any dispute while sharing the water. God also sent clouds to protect
them from the scorching sun. And when they were hungry, He sent a special delicious
food called ‘Manna’ But in spite of
God’s generosity, many people kept complaining
to the Prophet. Musa (as) scolded the people and reminded them
that they had just left a life of slavery. He asked them to be happy instead,
and thank God for His generosity. The children of Israelites
were broken people, unable to stay away from
sin and corruption. They were tired of Manna, and
tired of the travelling. They wondered if there was really
a place called Caanan after all! The people kept travelling through
the desert for days and days. They were walking with no destination,
day and night, morning and evening. Eventually they
entered the Sinai. The Prophet realized that this was the place where
he had spoken to God before his journey to Egypt. Musa(as) decided to
climb the mountain. So He called His brother, and asked Him to take charge of the
people while He was gone. But before climbing
the mountain, God ordered the Prophet
to fast for thirty days. On the thirtieth day, God, then asked
the Prophet to fast for ten more days. After the fast was completed, Musa (as) was
ready to speak to the Lord once again. He then started
climbing the mountain. The climb was long
and difficult. Once He reached the top,
God gave him two tablets, in which the special laws to govern
the Israelites were written! Musa (as) had gone for forty days,
and the people grew restless. They were like children, complaining
and acting impulsively. Among them, there was a man named Samiri,
who was more inclined towards the evil. He suggested that they
needed another guide, and he told them that the
Prophet had deserted them “In order to find true
guidance, you need a true God” He shouted to the Israelites. “I shall provide you one” He started collecting all
their jewelry at first. Then he dug a hole on the ground,
in which he placed a lot, and put all the jewelry inside. Then he lit a fire! Samiri then made a golden
calf out of the molten metal It was as if they had
succeeded in making a God! Haroon (as), the brother of the Prophet was
afraid to stand up to the people at first. But when he saw the
idol, he spoke up “You are committing a grave
sin” he shouted to them. He warned them of the
consequences for their actions. “We shall stop worshipping this God
only when Musa returns” They replied Those who remained true to their belief
separated themselves from the idol worshippers. They stood along
with Haroon (as) When Musa (as) returned, he saw his
people dancing around the idol! His heart was filled with
shame and anger now! He threw the tablets to
the ground in his anger. He then tugged Haroon’s
beard and his hair crying “What held you back when you saw
 them doing this?”  “Why did you not fight them?” “O son of my mother, let
go of my beard” “They were about to kill me!” The Prophet understood
Haroon’s helplessness, and he began to handle the
situation calmly and wisely. He called Samiri and said
“Get away from here” “You shall live the rest
of your life alone” The Prophet sent him
to exile forever He knew that God was going to punish
them for worshipping the idol. So He chose seventy seniors from
each tribe and ordered them “Rush towards Allah and
repent for what you have done” He then started climbing Mount Sinai
 with the seventy elders. Once they reached the top, the Prophet
asked the elders to wait for him, and he walked ahead. There he started
communicating with God. The elders could hear Musa speaking with
the God, but they could not see Him. The Prophet returned after
sometime, and the elders told him “O Musa! We shall never believe in
you until we see Allah(swt) ourselves!” Their stubborn demand was rewarded
with punishing thunderbolts, and an earthquake that killed
all of them instantly!! The Prophet was very sad now. He wondered what he would say
to the children of Israelites. Those seventy men were
the best of the people. So he turned to God, and
prayed for forgiveness. Allah(swt) heard his prayers, and He
raised the dead people back to life. The children of Israel wandered
in the desert for many years. The Prophet suffered greatly because
of the ignorance of his people!. He suffered everything for
the sake of his people. God never let them reach the promised land because of the sins committed
by the Israelites. After a few years,
 Prophet Haroon (as) died, while they were wandering in the desert. When the time of death
for Musa (as) arrived, the angel of death was
sent to the Prophet. When the angel came to the Prophet,
he slapped him on the eye!! The angel returned
to Lord and said “You had sent me to a slave
who didn’t want to die! Then Allah(swt) said
“Return to him now. When you meet him, ask him to put
his hand on the back of an ox. Tell him that for every hair that
comes under his arm, he will be granted one year of life! The angel returned to the Prophet
and gave him Allah’s message “What will happen after that?” “Death” said the Angel “Then let it come now”
replied the Prophet. The Prophet then requested Allah(swt)
to let him die close to the Holy Land, so that He could atleast
see it from a distance Allah(swt) granted his request,
and he died shortly after Prophet Musa (as) , the one to whom
Allah(swt) spoke directly, met his death with a contended soul
and a faithful heart. Mashallah! That was
such an amazing story! The Story of Prophet Musa (as)
was really inspiring, wasn’t it? Yes, it was Baba! Now shall I start asking
you a few questions? Why did the Prophet leave Egypt
along with the Israelites? The Egyptians never heeded the Prophet’s
request to free the Israelites, in spite of the
miracles he performed. That’s why he had to leave Egypt How did the Pharaoh die? God parted the red sea, for the Prophet
and the Israelites.  But when the Pharoah entered the river,
the water came crashing down on him. Very good my son. Now tell me what was written on the
tablets that God gave the Prophet God gave him two tablets,
 in which the special laws to govern the Israelites were written! Masha Allah!
That was the right answer. That’s all for today my son! I will tell you another
story tomorrow! Good night my son! Good night Baba"
"Assalamu Alaikum Walaikum Assalam Are you going to tell me
the story of Prophet’s today? Yes of course!
You sound so excited! I love hearing these stories baba Mashallah! That’s great. Today I will tell you
 the story of Prophet Ayub (as) Who is he Baba ? Ayub (as) is a Prophet in Islam, and his name is mentioned
 in the Quran. The Quran also describes the Prophet
as a righteous servant of Allah, who had to undergo the test of
 Allah for a very long period of time! Now listen carefully! Bismillah! The Story of Prophet Ayub (as) A long long time ago, there lived
 a man named Prophet Ayub (as).  He was one the grandsons
 of Prophet Yusuf (as). He had a wife named Rahma.
 Both of them led a very happy life. Allah (swt) blessed the Prophet
with many sons and daughters. He was a wealthy man, and
he owned plenty of land. He owned a large number
 of cattles as well. He was one of the sincere
worshippers of Allah (swt). He was thankful to Allah for all
the blessings endowed upon him. He loved the poor, and he
 gave them food and clothes. He always invited an orphan or
 a poor person to eat with him. One day it so happened that the Angels were discussing
about Allah’s faithful servants. “The best creature on earth
today is Ayub” said one of the angels. “He is a man of noble character, and he always remembers
 his generous Lord. He is an excellent model
 for the Allah’s followers” Then another angel said “In return,  Lord has blessed him with a
 long life and plenty of servants”. “He helps the poor and the needy.
 He also buys the slaves, and set them free!
He is a very generous man” Added another angel.
Shaytan overheard their conversation, and he became very annoyed.
He decided to go to the Prophet and tempt him to go
against his God. First, he tried to distract him
from his prayers  by whispering about all the
good things in life! But Ayub (as) was a true believer, and the evil thoughts did not
 tempt him at all! When his trick failed,
Shaytan got really angry!! Shaytan then complained to Allah
about Ayub.  He said that although the Prophet
 kept praying to God, he was not a sincere person. Shaytan said that the Prophet
was trying to satisfy Allah, so that God  wont take his
wealth away from him! “If you remove his wealth,
then you will find that  he will no longer mention
 Your name!  He will even stop praying
 to you!” But Allah told Shaytan that Ayub  was one of His most sincere devotees.  The Prophet, He said, did not
worship Him because of the favors he received. Allah wanted to show Shaytan the depth of the Prophet’s sincerity. So He allowed Shaythan to do
 whatever he wished with Ayub’s wealth. Shaytan was very happy now! He gathered his helpers and
started destroying all that the Prophet owned!
He burned his farms, cattles and he didn’t leave
 his house as well! Then he destroyed all
of Prophet’s servants. Ayub (as) was now left
 with no possessions. Rubbing his hand in glee, Shaytan then approached the
Prophet disguised as an old man! “All your wealth is lost”
He said to the Prophet.  Some people say that this is because you gave too much to others as charity. Some are saying that you are
wasting your time with your prayers! “If Allah had the power to prevent
 you from getting harmed, He would have protected you” But the Prophet’s faith was
 not shaken even a little bit.  “What Allah has taken away,
belongs to Him” He replied. “I was only a caretaker
of all of His possessions. He gives to whom who He wills, and withholds from whom He wills” With these words, the Prophet
 again prostrated to his Lord When Shaytan saw this,
he felt frustrated! So he addressed Allah (swt) again! “I have stripped Ayub of
all of his possessions, but still he remains grateful to You!” He said to the Lord. “The real test
 of a parent is through his children! You will see how he rejects you,
 when he loses his children” Allah gave Shaytan the authority
 to do what he wanted. He also warned him that the Prophet’s
 faith and patience will not reduce,  inspite of whatever Shaytan
 had planned for. Shaytan again gathered his helpers and set out to destroy the Prophet’s children. He destroyed the house in
which the sons and daughters lived, killing all of them! Then he went to the Prophet,  disguised as a man who came
 to sympathize with him. He said to the Prophet in
 a comforting tone “The circumstances under which your children died were really sad. Surely, your Lord is not rewarding
 you properly for all your prayers” Then the Shaytan waited anxiously hoping the Prophet was
 now ready to reject Allah (swt) But the Prophet said “Allah
 sometimes gives, and sometimes takes. He is sometimes pleased,
 and sometimes displeased with what we do. Whatever happens, I will remain firm in my belief and remain
 thankful to my creator” And then, the Prophet
prostrated to his Lord. Shaytan was very angry
 when he saw that. Shaytan called to Allah again! “Oh lord” He said.
“Ayub has lost all of his wealth, and his children are dead. As long as he remains healthy,
 he wil continue to worship You, hoping that he can produce
 more children. Grant me authority over
his body so that I may weaken it. He will then surely neglect worshipping, and
he will turn disobedient.” Allah (swt) wanted to teach
 Shaytan a lesson. So He granted his third request, but one one condition.
 It was that Shaytan will have authority over
the Prophet’s body but not over his soul or intellect. Shaytan was very happy,
as he knew that the Prophet was surely going to give
up on his God this time. Armed with this new authority Shaytan began to afflict the body
 of the Prophet with diseases After sometime, the Prophet was
 reduced to mere skin and bones! But the Prophet stayed strong
in his faith amidst all the sufferings. He did not despair or turn
 to others for help, and remained hopeful
 of Allah’s mercy. His close relatives, and even
friends deserted him. Only his kind and loving
wife stayed with him. She showered her kindness
on the Prophet, and cared for him in this hour of need. Shaytan had now become desperate, so he decided to approach
 the Prophet’s wife this time. He went to her in the form of a man, and asked her “Where is your husband?” She pointed to an almost lifeless form on the bed and said “There he is, hanging between
life and death” Shaytan then reminded her of the days when the Prophet was in good health, and when he had all 
his wealth and children. She was suddenly overcome with
he pain of years of hardship, and she burst into tears. “How long are you going to bear this torture from our Lord” she asked him crying. “Are we
  going to remain without wealth, children or friends forever?. Why don’t you call upon Allah to
remove this suffering? The prophet sighed and
replied in a soft voice “Shaytan must have whispered
to you and made you upset. Tell me how long did I enjoy
good health and the riches?” He asked “Seventy years”
 she replied. “How long have I been
 suffering like this now?” He asked her again “Seven years” she replied The Prophet then told her “In that case,  I am ashamed to call on my Lord
to remove the hardships. I have not suffered longer than the
years of good health and prosperity!” He then told her “It seems
 your faith has weakened and you are dissatisfied with our Lord If I ever regain my health, I swear I will punish you with a
 hundred strokes” The Prophet then ordered her to leave the house and never come back again. The Prophet’s wife cried bitterly and with a heavy heart left the house. In this helpless state,
the Prophet prayed to Allah, not to complain, but to
 seek His mercy. “Oh lord” he prayed “Harm has inflicted me, and You are the Most Merciful” Allah (swt) accepted the
prayer of the Prophet, and turned to him with mercy. He commanded the Prophet to
 strike the earth with his foot. The Prophet obeyed the order, and suddenly a spring
arose from the ground!! He took a bath in the water
as God ordered him, and suddenly he was cured!! Meanwhile, his faithful wife could no longer bear to be
 parted from her husband, so she returned to him with
 a desire to serve him. she was amazed to at
the sudden change! The Prophet was healthy again! She embraced him and
thanked Allah for His mercy. Ayoub (as) was now worried
 about the oath he had taken. In his anger, he had taken
an oath to punish her with a hundred strokes,
 if he regained his health. He did not want to hurt her but he could not break a promise
 made to Allah as well! Allah (swt), in His wisdom and mercy,  came to solve the dilemma of
 His faithful servant. God asked him to take
 a bundle of thin grass, and gently strike his wife
with the bundle. This way the Prophet didn’t
have to break his oath!! The Prophet soon regained his wealth, and his children were
 raised from the dead! It is said that Prophet Ayoub (as)
 lived till the age of 93 years!! This story should remind us
 that Allah (swt) would test is in many ways.
We should, therefore, remain strong in our faith,
 and worship Him constantly Mashallah! That was such
 a wonderful story! Now are you ready for the questions? Yes, I am! Alright, now tell me how did the Shaytan
try to distract the Prophet, in his first attempt?  he tried to distract him from his prayers by whispering about all
 the good things in life! And did the Prophet get distracted? No.. The Prophet was a true believer, and he didn’t get distracted at all! That’s correct! Now tell me how did he test
the Prophet, the second time? Shaytan said that the Prophet
was trying to satisfy God so that God wont take away
 his wealth from him! He then burned down all the
possessions of the Prophet! Mashallah! That’s right again! And did the Prophet stop
worshipping Allah this time? No.. The Prophet said that it was God
 who gave him all his possessions, so it didn’t really matte
r when God took it back Very good! Now tell me how did
 Shaytan test him the third time? Shaytan took God’s permission to kill
all of the Prophet’s children! And did the Prophet stop praying
 to Allah after his children were killed? No, the Prophet did not stop praying
 to God, and this made Shaytan very angry! And how did he test the
Prophet for the final time? Shaytan took permission from God,
 and afflicted the body of
 the Prophet with diseases. And did this make the Prophet
 stop worshipping God? No.. the Prophet stayed strong in his
 faith amidst all the sufferings He did not despair or turn
 to others for help, and remained hopeful of God’s mercy Mashallah! All your answers were correct
Very good! Thank you ! Alright, I will see you again tomorrow
 with another story. Good night my son! 	Good night !"
"Hmm.. All the shows on TV are so boring! I wonder why Papa is so late today! Boring! Boring! No.. Boring!! AssalamuAlaikukum WalaikumAssalam Baba! Where were you? Do you know how long
I had been waiting for you? I’m sorry my son.. I had so much work at the office today! That’s why I am late. Hmm.. That’s alright! What were you doing my dear? I was watching TV Baba! What were you watching on TV? Nothing particularly!!
All the shows were boring on TV Inshallah, what if I tell you
the story of another prophet today!! That would be amazing!!!
Thank you so much baba! Alright, today I will tell you
the story of Prophet Shuaib (as)! Who was he baba? Many elderly scholars believe that
Shuaib (AS) was the elderly man who offered safety to Musa (as).
Prophet Musa (as) had married the daughter of Prophet Shuaib (as)
before he fled to Egypt. There are no authentic sources
confirming or denying this. However, Quran tells us that the
Prophet was from the people of Madyan, and it was there that
Prophet Musa (as) found refuge. Mashallah! That sounds so interesting!
Please tell me the story. Alright, now listen carefully Bismillah! The story of Prophet Shuaib (as) The people of Madyan were Arabs
who lived in the country of Ma’an, part of which is known today as
greater Syria. They were a bunch of greedy people
who refused to believe in Allah (swt), and they led a wicked life. The people as a whole were thieves
and robbers, deceiving one another. They also looted the travelers who
were passing through their townships. The people of Madyan were mostly traders.
They gave short measure while selling goods praised their goods beyond their worth,and
hide their defects. They lied to their customers thereby
cheating them. And instead of worshipping Allah (swt)
the true god, they worshipped a tree!! That was when God send prophet Shuaib to
call his people to worship Allah (swt)alone Hazrat Shuaib (as) preached to them,
begging them to be mindful of Allah’s favors, and warning them
the consequences of their evil ways. But the people mocked at him and said: You want us to worship
the God who you worship? How can you expect us to leave
the religion of our forefathers? You want us to be fair while trading? You want us to deal honestly and
suffer our losses? When the prophet said yes, “Never” replied the people.
We will never listen to you! We would have stoned you, if you were not
old and without children” warned the people But the prophet ignored their warning and
 continued to preach to the people. He told the people not to hate the truth
and reject God’s call. He reminded them of the punishment
God sent to Lut (as) people. The people of Madyan were the first to
impose fees and tolls on the people who passed through their territory. The prophet preached to them and tried
his best to convince them to lead an honest life. But the people insisted on leading a
life by robbing and cheating other people despite the prophets warnings. The prophet did not lose hope even then! He preached to them during the day,
and the night! He reminded them that he was trying
do what is best for them, and not for his own personal gain. By now, the disbelievers got really angry. They forcefully took the belongings
of the prophet and his followers! The people of Madyan then threw
them out of the city. And they then challenged him to bring
the punishment upon them! The prophet had by now lost
all his hope on the people, so he turned to his Lord for help.
And His request was answered very soon! And finally the day of the punishment
arrived! God made the sun unbearably hot and
scorching for the people of Madyan. The hot weather lasted for no
less than seven days! The people of Madyan tried to cool
themselves with water, but that didn’t help at all.. The people suffered terribly
for seven days!! The wells dried up,
and the plants fell to the ground Then God send a huge dark and
gloomy cloud to the city! “Look, its about to rain” said the
people when they saw the cloud. The people thought that the cloud would
bring them rain, and bring down the heat. So they ran out in joy hoping
the clouds would bring them the rain! Little did they know that this was
Allah’s punishment for them! All the disbelievers had by now
gathered under the cloud! Then suddenly, from the clouds came
thunderbolts and fire!! The huge thunderbolts caused the ground
to shake, and people fell one by one. The flames of fire then burned
everyone to ashes! When the prophet returned to the city next
day, he saw that no one was alive in Madyan Like in Thamud, the people lay dead on the
ground, and all the disbelievers were destroyed. Madyan’s wealth didn’t save them from
Allah’s punishment. Seeing the destruction, Shuaib (as) said that he didn’t feel sorry
for them since they were fighting against Allah, and he had tried to warn them
many times. Mashallah! It was such a wonderful story! Hmm.. Prophet Shuaib (as) went on to live
for many more years! Did you know that it he who gave
food and shelter to Prophet Musa (as), when had escaped from Egypt? Huh? I didn’t know that! Please
tell me Baba Ha haa.. Alright Prophet Moosa (as) had escaped from Egypt
and away from the eyes of his people. He travelled for many days in the desert,
and he finally reached Madyan. The prophet was very thirsty, so
he went near a well to drink water from it. But when he arrived near the well, he saw
a crowd of people making their animals drink water from the well. He saw two women standing aside,
waiting for their turn. “Why are you standing over here?”
he asked them. “We cannot give water to our animals till
the shepherds feed their cattle” said one of them. “Our father is a very old man, and he is
waiting for us to get him the water” said the other. On hearing this, the prophet went to the
well,and took the bucket from the shepherds Everyone moved aside and made way
for the prophet. He then drew water from the well,
and gave it to the sisters. The prophet then went and sat under a tree. Hardly a few moments had lapsed when one
of the sisters who had gone to their house, returned, and said to the prophet “My father has called you to reward you for
the trouble you took for us” she told him. The prophet agreed and went with her. Prophet Musa (as) met Prophet Shuaib (as)
and told him his story. “You have gained freedom from your
oppressors” said Prophet Shuaib (as). That’s when one of his daughter suggested
that they should employ him because he was strong and trustworthy “You have witnessed his strength at
the well” said the prophet. “But how do you know of his
trustworthiness?” he asked The daughter replied “When he started
coming towards the house, he asked us to walk behind him, and told us that he comes
from a household where the males do not look at the females” Prophet Shuaib (as) was very happy with
him and he said “It is my desire that I get you married
to one of my daughters. But on the condition that you will tend
my cattle for eight years!. Prophet Musa (as) accepted the offer
and married Safura. He then took care of the cattle for
eight long years as he had promised!! Mashallah, that was such a great story I’m glad you liked it my dear. Now shall
I ask you a few questions from the story I’m ready!! Ha haa..
Alright, now here is the first question. What were the sins that the people of
Madyan committed? Hmm.. First was they cheated with
the scales. Am I right Baba? Yes.. go on.. what were their other sins? Worshipping false gods and and.. robbery! Ha ha haa.. That’s very good amir. Now tell me how God punished the people
of Madyan? God first send a scorching heat that
lasted for seven long days! The wells dried up, and plants died.
Then on the seventh day, he send a huge cloud that showered rain of
fire! This killed all the people of Madyan. Mashallah, That’s correct my son!
That’s all for today, I will tell you the story of another
prophet tomorrow. Good night amir.. Good night Baba!"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! You are early today Baba! My work got over early today! I’ll pray to Allah(swt) that you
finish your work early every day! That’s so sweet of you!
So what are you doing now? Nothing, I finished all my homework
 sometime back and I was thinking of watching TV That’s good.. then let us
watch the TV together then! No Baba.. I don’t find the
shows on TV interesting. I like your stories
more than that! Mashallah! That’s very good! It is important that you learn the
 works of the Prophets! You can learn so many
things from their lives It is true! In fact my friends also
loves the stories of Prophets! Are you telling the stories
to your friends too? Of course I am! They always beg me to tell
them the story of Prophets. I tell them during our breaks! Masha Allah! You are
such a good boy! Can you tell me another
story today please? Insha Allah I will. Which was the
story that I told you yesterday? You told me the story of Prophet
Sulaiman (as) yesterday! Then the next one is going to be
the story of Prophet Isaiah (as) Who was he Baba? Prophet Isaiah (as) lived after the time
 of Prophet Dawud (as). He is one of those who prophesized about
 Prophet Isa (as) before He was born! Now listen carefully Bismillah! The Story of Prophet Isaiah (as) Prophet Isaiah (as) lived during the time
when King Hazkiah was ruling the country. Hazkia was a good king, and a
faithful follower of Allah(swt). He also listened to Isaiah (as),
and sought advice from him. The kingdom prospered under the good king,
and the people liked him very much One day the King became
sick with an infected foot! It was during this time that
he heard a terrible news. The messenger ran into the
palace, and he shouted “King Sinharib of Babylon
is coming to attack us!” It was true! The evil king Sinharib was approaching
Israel with an army of sixty thousand men!! The King got worried when he heard about
the news and he asked the Prophet “Why did Allah(swt) reveal to you
about Sinharib and his army?” “Nothing” said the Prophet. “He has not yet revealed
anything to me! The King was sad. Even if he had to fight, he
couldn’t because of his sick leg! That night when the Prophet was praying,
he received a revelation from Allah! Next the Prophet went to meet
the king to pass on the message “Allah wants you to appoint a
successor, for your end is near” When the Prophet told him this,
the good king turned to Qibla, and he started praying
with a sincere heart “O lord of Lords, and
God of Gods” he prayed! “You know what is better than I do, my
open acts and secrets are with you!” When Allah (swt) heard the
sincere prayers of Hazkia, he felt compassionate for him That night when the
Prophet was praying, Allah revealed to the Prophet that He was
going to extend the life of Hazkia for another fifteen years! God wanted him to extract the water
of the fig and apply to his sore. He also revealed that the King
would be saved from his enemy! The next day, the Prophet rushed to
inform the king about the good news! When the King heard about
this, he was overjoyed! The king applied water of the fig
on his sore, as he was commanded It was a miracle! The sores
got cured immediately The King was happy now, he
prostrated on the ground, praying “O Lord, You grant mercy and answer
the prayers of the troubled ones”! The next day, King Sinharib was shocked to find his
 soldiers lying dead on the ground. Allah had done what he had
 promised the Prophet. No one was alive, except for the
king and five of his companions! King Hazkia arrested them and
took them back to his kingdom He put Sinharib and his
companions in shackles and displayed them in his
kingdom for seventy days! After seventy days, Allah
revealed to Prophet Isaiah (as) to send Sinharib and his companions
back to their country. When the Prophet informed
 Hazkia about this, he released them immediately. When Sinharib returned to his people, he gathered all of them, including his 
ministers and advisors. He then told them about
what had happened. How his soldiers were killed, and how he was
shackled and displayed for seventy days The Priests and his magicians came forward,
 and told the king “We warned you before about their God 
and their Prophets” they said “But you did not
listen” said another. “It is a nation which
nobody can overcome” Sinharib was afraid now, and he never ever thought of attacking the
 land of Prophet Isaiah (as) again! Mashallah! That
was a great story I’m glad you liked it my son! Hazkia was such a good king! Isnt that why God
helped him so much? Yes my son, He was a good Muslim,
and a faithful follower of Allah(swt) Now shall I ask you
a few questions? I’m ready Alright, now tell the name of
the king who attacked Israel? It was King Sinharib of Babylon That’s correct! What
was Hazkia’s sickness? The King became sick
with an infected foot! What did Allah(swt) reveal
to the Prophet first? Allah revealed to the Prophet that 
Hazkia’s death was near, and that he should appoint a successor That’s wonderful! And did
he appoint a successor? No.. When Hazkia heard about
 the revelation, he prayed to Allah(swt), and he got cured! God then gave him another
fifteen years to live!! How was Sinharib and his
companions punished? They were shackled, and displayed
in Israel for seventy days. And what happened after that? They were released and
they returned to Babylon Did Sinharib attack
Israel again? No! He was afraid of the Gods and Prophets
of Israel, and he never attacked again! Masha Allah! You gave all
the right answers today Thank you Baba!"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! Are you feeling sleepy now? I don’t know Baba, I was tired the whole day,
and feeling very sleepy Alright.. Have you heard the story
 of Prophet Uzair (as),  who slept for one hundred years? One hundred years! How can anyone sleep that long? I think you should
go to sleep now.. I will tell you his
story tomorrow! No Baba.. My sleep is gone! I want to hear his story now!
Please tell me Baba Are you sure? Yes! I will never be able to sleep
till I hear the story of this Prophet! Sleeping for one hundred
years, that sounds so amazing! Alright.. Inshallah, I will tell you the story
of Prophet Uzair (as) now. Now listen carefully! Bismillah! The Story of Prophet Uzair (as) Prophet Uzair (as) was a
saint and a wise man. He lived after Prophet Sulaiman (as)
and before Prophet Zakariyah (as). One day, as usual, the Prophet was going
to visit his farm, on his donkey. By around noon, he came to a small town
that was ruined a long time ago, and no one lived there anymore. All that he could see was the
collapsed buildings, dusty walls, and well, a lot of human bones! The Prophet had been travelling all
morning, and the sun was scorching hot now. So he decided to take
some rest in that town. He got down from his donkey,
and sat under the tree. He was very hungry, so he took the figs and the
grapes he had in his basket, and started eating them He sat there for sometime, and
then he stood up to see around. He saw that the walls that still stood
up, were very old and shattered. He thought that they
could fall down anytime! He then saw the human
bones lying around! “How will Allah bring
them back to life?” He said out of curiosity When Allah (swt) heard what he
had just said, he got angry, and decided to show the
Prophet His power! He sent the Angel of Death
to Prophet Uzair (as) The Angel of Death took the
Prophet’s life as he had been told! The Prophet lay there,
lifeless for a long long time. It is said that the Prophet lay
dead for about one hundred years! The Prophet’s donkey died
in the meantime, and lots of things changed
during those 100 years! One day God decided to wake
the Prophet from his death, and he sent the Angel of
Death again to the Prophet The Angel arrived, and revived
the Prophet back from the dead! When the Prophet opened his eyes,
he didn’t know what was going on ! “For how long did you
sleep” asked the angel It was late afternoon, and the Prophet
had gone to sleep early afternoon. “I must have slept for a day, or part
of a day” he said as he was confused “You remained asleep for 100
years!” said the angel! The Prophet was
shocked to hear that! He realized that it was by the power
of God that he came back to life The angel then revived the
Prophet’s donkey as well. The Prophet then started
travelling back to his home! When He reached his native
place, he was surprised again! The whole town had
changed by now! There were new shops, new streets,
and he couldn’t recognize anyone! And when He reached his house, he
couldn’t recognize anybody there either! “I am Uzair” he told
them again and again. But they shook their head and told
him that they don’t know him. He then went to the crippled
old woman sitting outside. He realized that she
was blind as well! “Isn't this the house of
Uzair?” he asked her “Yes it is” she said. “But people have long forgotten about him.
He was gone around 100 years ago!” The Prophet realized that this old woman
was actually his maid during those times. “I am Uzair!” he told her. “Allah had taken my life, and now after
100 years, He has returned it to me” The Old maid was able to recognize
the voice, but she was not sure. So she told the Prophet “Allah(swt)
used to answer Uzair’s prayers. If you are Uzair, then pray to Allah that
I might see, and pray that I may walk The Prophet agreed. He prostrated, and
prayed to Allah(swt) Then He stood up, placed his fingers
on her eyes, and gently massaged them He took hands and said, “Get
up by the power of Allah” It was a miracle!! She
could see everything now!! Then she stood up by herself, and
she could walk all by herself! The Old woman was overjoyed!! She told the Prophet happily “Yes!
What you are saying is the truth! I bear witness that
you are Uzair!” She then asked the Prophet to
 come along with her, and they went to assembly of
 Israelites nearby. The Prophet’s son who was 118 years
old now, was heading the assembly. Even his children, and grand
children were part of the assembly! The Old maid called out to them “Look at him! Do you
recognize who He is? But no one recognized, and
they shook their heads! “He is your father, Uzair!
He is back! “You are lying” His son said, how
can he be back after 100 years?” “Look at me” she said
“I am your old maid. Was I able to see before? And when
did you last see me walking?. You father prayed to Allah for me,
and here I am walking and seeing!!” The Prophet’s son stood
up, and approached them. “My father had a black mole between
his shoulders” he told the Prophet. “We will believe you, if
you can show me that mark” The Prophet showed him the mark, and his son realized that He was
 indeed his father. Everyone came and embraced the Prophet,
they were happy that he was back! When the Prophet was
asleep, Nebuchadnazzer, the evil King of Babylon had destroyed
all the copies of Torah  to destroy their religion. No one remembered the Torah now. The only copy left in the world, was buried
somewhere, and that only the Prophet knew. “Allah is truly great”
one his grandson said. “Only you can tell us where
the last copy of the Torah is” Prophet Uzair (as) took the people  to the place where he knew where
 the Torah was buried. And he took out the copy. The people were very happy to see
the book, they thought was lost! The leaves of the book had rotten by
now, and the book itself was crumpled. Prophet Uzair (as) sat under the
 shade of a tree, surrounded by children, to copy the book. He carefully copied the words from
the script, and made a new book! The Prophet died when he was forty
 years old in Israel Mashallah! That was
such a great story! Sleeping for one hundred years!
It’s a great wonder I’m glad that you liked
the story my son! What was the name of that ruined
town where Prophet had slept? Some say that the
town was Sayrabadh! Alright, now are you
ready for the questions? Yes Baba! Why did God put Prophet
Uzair (as) to sleep? It was because the Prophet had doubted
the power of God for a moment And how long did
the Prophet sleep? He slept for one hundred years! Did people recognize the Prophet
when he came back home? No! No one recognized the Prophet,
as he was gone for 100 years! And who was the first
person to recognize him? It was his maid! Very good. Now tell me why were
there no copies of Torah in Israel? The evil king of Babylon had destroyed all the
copies of Torah in Israel,except for one. Who copied the Torah? The Prophet did! Masha Allah! You gave me
all the right answers!! Thank you Baba You can go to sleep now. Good night Good night baba!"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum assalam! Tell me the remaining story
of the Prophet Baba! You look so excited today Amir! Yes I am! Inshallah, I will tell you another
story of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh ) today. Now listen carefully Bismillah! The Story of Prophet
Muhammad (pbuh) In the last episode, we saw how Prophet
Muhammad (saw) got orphaned as a child, and how His uncle Abu
Talib, brought him up. The Prophet then married Khadija (ra), and eventually settled in Makkah. The Prophet from His humble beginnings, had
now become wealthy, and quite respected. Khadija (ra) gave birth to
three sons and four daughters But none of the male children survived,
they all died in childhood itself The Prophet loved Ali very much,
and he found consolation in Him It was during this time that a group Arab
 plunderers captured Zayd, a young boy, from the arms of his mother. These plunderers then sold the boy
as a slave in the market of ‘Ukaz Zayd was bought by a relative of Khadija,
and He gave him as a gift to her. Khadija in turn gave the boy
to the Prophet as a gift. The Prophet became very attached to Zayd, to whom He referred as Al-Habib, 
which means ‘the beloved’ Zayd considered the Prophet to be
His mentor, and followed His ways. The boy had a spiritual mind and
good morals of the Prophet. In the meantime, Zayd’s parents were
still grieving at the loss of their son. They prayed on a daily basis that their
beloved son would be returned to them One day, the parents of Zayd visited
Makkah to perform the pilgrimage. It was here that they spotted Zayd, and
with great relief, they rushed towards him. When his father came to know 
about this wonderful news, He loaded his bags with gold,
 and approached Muhammad. The father thought that He can
purchase his son back from His owner. Zayd’s father met the Prophet and
asked Him to release his boy Then the Prophet asked him “Who is this person,  whose release you are demanding?” “Your slave Zayd Ibn Haritha” 
replied the father “Shall I show you a way by which
 you can get your son back,  without paying the gold” The father was surprised, and he asked “What is this way you are talking about?” “I will call him here
in front of you. If he wishes to go with you,  then he is free to do so.  You can take him gladly, 
and I will take now payment from you” “But” the Prophet continued  “If he prefers to stay with me, then I will not force him to go with you” Zayd’s father agreed,
and they called the boy The Prophet then explained the choices he
had, and asked him to make a decision. “I will stay with you”
 the boy said immediately. His father was shocked
to hear this! Then he asked him  “Don’t you want to stay with your parent? Or do you prefer to
remain as a slave?” “Father” said the boy “I am deeply moved by the
 qualities of this man, and by the way he treats me 
with love and affection. I can never leave him and
live anywhere else.” The Prophet’s heart swelled
when he heard this. He led Zayd to the centre of the town,
 and He proclaimed loudly  “This is my son,  and we inherit each other” As a result,  Zayd bin Haritha was renamed
 Zayd bin Muhammad  as it was customary during those days!  This cordial relationship
 lasted till his last breath. Prophet Muhammad (saw) was
approaching the age of forty. He was very sad looking at
the condition of his people. His country was torn into wars, and
his people were sunk in barbarism. They were addicted to superstitions
and idol worshipping. The people were always
fighting with each other. The Prophet had a habit of secluding
 himself in a cave on Mount Hira, just a few miles from Mecca. He used to pray and meditate inside
this cave, most of the time alone. Here he often spent the nights in deep thought and profound
communion with the All-Knowing Allah of the universe. It was during one of these nights when 
no one was near him,  that an angel appeared
  before Him!! The Prophet was amazed by the sight of the
angel!  He couldn’t believe His eyes!! The Angel then asked
the Prophet to read! But how could the Prophet read,
when he had never gone to school? “I am not a reader”
He said to the angel. Then suddenly, the angel took hold
of him, and squeezed him tightly! The angel said again “Read” “I am not a reader, the
Prophet cried again!” The angel then squeezed 
the Prophet so hard,  that he thought that he would faint! And he said “Read!  In the Name of Your Lord and cherisher, who created man, out of a clot 
of congealed blood. Read! And your Lord in the most Generous,  Who has taught writing by the pen- taught  man which he knew not” The Prophet repeated the words
with a trembling heart! Perplexed by his experience,
Prophet made His way to home. As soon as He entered his house,  He said to His wife  “Wrap me up!
 Wrap me up!” He was trembling as He said this,  and She wrapped
Him up in a towel, until his fear was gone. He explained to his
wife what had happened. When He finished, He asked Her
if she thought He had gone mad! “Allah forbid!” She replied “He will surely not let such a thing
 happen, for you speak the truth,  you are faithful in trust, you assist your fellow men” Then She went to her cousin Warawa
Ibn Naufal, who was old and blind. But He knew the scriptures quite well,
he had translated them into Arabic. When she told him about what happened to
her Husband, he cried out “Holy! Holy! This is the Holy Spirit
that came to Moses! He will be the Prophet
for His people! Tell him this and ask Him
to be brave at heart! The Prophet continued to receive
revelations for the remainder of His life. It was memorized and written down
by His companions on sheepskins The Prophet knew that the people
had to hear the message from God. So, He started preaching to
the people what God told him. For the first few years of His mission,  the Prophet preached to His 
family and close friends. The first woman to convert
was His wife Khadija (ra). And the first bondsman
was His servant- Zayd! His old friend Abu Bakr, was the first adult free male to convert. Many years later, the Prophet said this about him “I have never called anyone to Islam who
 was not at first hesitant, except Abu Bakr. Later, the Prophet received the
 command to preach openly. Mashallah! That was
such an amazing story! I’m glad you liked it Amir Did the people hate the Prophet? Yes Amir That was very unfortunate! Like every other Prophet,  He too had to face countless rejections,
 and hatred from His people. But this didn’t let the Prophet down,  and He continued to
preach to his people,  delivering the message of Allah (swt) Now, are you ready
for the questions? Yes, I am! Alright, now tell me how
Zayd met the Prophet? Zayd was kidnapped by some Arabs, and
then sold as a slave in local market. He was bought by a
relative of Khadija. When she married the Prophet, she
gave Zayd as a gift to her husband. That’s correct! But why didn’t Zayd leave
the Prophet when his parents arrived? The Prophet never treated Zayd as
a slave, and He treated him well. Also, Zayd had never met a more gentler
 person than the Prophet. That’s why he chose to
 stay with the Prophet. That’s right again! What was the name of the mountain
where Prophet regularly worshipped? It was Mount Hira! That’s right again! Now tell me why wasn’t the Prophet able
to read when the Angel asked him to? Prophet was never schooled  so He didn’t know how to read or write! Who was the first woman
to convert to Islam? It was His wife- Khadija And who was the first child
to convert to Islam? It was the Prophet’s
first cousin- Ali What was the name of the first
bondsman to get converted into Islam? It was Zayd! And lastly, who was the first free
person to get converted into Islam? It was the Prophet’s
friend- Abu Bakr Mashallah,  you gave me all the right
 answers my son! Thank you Baba! That’s all for today,  I will tell you the remaining story of
 Prophet Muhammad (saw) tomorrow. Good night Baba!"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! I was waiting for you Baba! You look so excited! Yes Baba! I really
want to know what happened to the Prophet! Did the people throw him in fire? What happened to him? Haha.. Alright, I will tell you the
rest of the story now. Listen carefully. Bismillah! Prophet Ibrahim (as) and the great fire! When people realized that it was
Prophet Ibrahim (as) who had destroyed the idols, they were really angry! They decided to burn him
 in the biggest fire anyone had seen before! First they dug a deep hole, to put the firewood. They gathered all the wood
they could find and started building a fire! The people kept adding the woods
 for days and days, and the fire grew stronger
 and stronger. It is said that the fire
grew so strong that no one could go near it
 because of the heat.  It was so tall that not even the
birds could fly above it! Many people heard about this
huge fire in Babylon,  and travelled to the city to witness
 this phenomenon! Then one day, the people tied the hands
and feet of Ibrahim(as), and placed him on a catalpult,  so that he could be thrown
into the fire. It was then that an angel from heaven
appeared before the prophet, and asked him if he wanted any
wish to be granted. The prophet could have easily
asked the angel to save him from the fire, but he did not. “I only wish for Allah (swt) to be
 pleased with me"" he said. What followed was a miracle! When the prophet landed
 in the fire, the fire suddenly got cold. It only burned the ropes that
 tied the prophet, and no harm came to the prophet! The prophet sat there amidst the fire, as if he was sitting in a garden! He sat there and sang
 praises of Allah(swt)! The people couldn’t see what
 was happening, so they waited for the fire 
to finish burning. And finally, when the fire
 went out, the prophet walked out of the fire with not
 a single burn in his body! The people were shocked 
to see this.! This was a miracle!!  “The God of Ibrahim(as) must
 be the true god” some of them said. But most of them were
 still angry with the prophet for destroying 
the idols! They decided to take the prophet for a 
trial to the king's palace. The soldiers came and arrested
 the prophet,  and took him to the palace
 of King Nimrod He was taken to the palace, with his hands chained. Nimrod had heard that the 
prophet had shattered  the idols he worshipped. “Tell me why you smashed the
 idols we worship” He asked the prophet ‘They were false idols, they were not God” replied the prophet “Then who is the true God ?”
 Nimrod asked The prophet politely replied “There is only one true God, Allah (swt), He gives life
 and death” The king got angry when he 
heard the prophet. He stood up angrily and said, “I can give life and death too. Wait and I’ll show you” He asked his soldiers to bring two of his
 slaves to the courtroom. He asked the slaves to
 kill the first one. The guard, on hearing the order struck the sword and killed
 one of the slave. “You see, I can give death” said Nimrod proudly. “Now kill the other one too” said Nimrod to the guard. But before the guard could strike the
 slave with his sword, he asked him to stop.  He then shouted to the guard, “Don’t kill him, 
let him live” ” He then turned to the
 prophet and said “I can give life too, 
you just saw that” The prophet replied “Allah(swt) make the sun rise
 from the east, can you make the sun rise
 from the west. Can you do that?” Nimrod was speechless! He was really angry with the prophet
 for confronting  him! Prophet Ibrahim (as) called the people
 to worship Allah(swt) for a long long time. There were nobody willing to
 listen in Babylon, except for one man
 and a woman! The woman's name was Sarah, and later she became his wife. The man’s name was Lut, who would later become a 
prophet as well! After years of calling 
people to Allah(swt), the prophet realized that nobody else was going to listen to his words. So, he decided to migrate 
to another country. He wanted to spread the message of
 Allah(swt) in another nation. The prophet then asked his
 father to join him,  but he refused. The prophet, the woman and
Lut (as) then started  their long long journey! They travelled through Syria, Palestine and Egypt calling out the
 people to Allah (swt). They helped the poor they could
 find on the way, and they did many good deeds
 that made people happy! In the meantime, the prophet Lut (as) migrated
 to the Dead Sea  and settled down there. And after a few months, the Prophet married Sarah! She was a good believer and they wanted to have children, who would spread the message of 
Allah(swt) after their time. The prophet and his wife travelled 
again for many days through the desert. One day, they happened to enter 
the territory of an evil king. The evil king came to know about the
 beautiful wife of the prophet, and he wanted to take her. So he send one of his soldiers to bring
 the prophet to him. The soldier brought the prophet 
before the king. “Who is the lady accompanying you?” asked the evil king, The prophet replied that
 she was his sister. The evil king then asked the prophet
 to bring Sarah to his court. He said that he wanted to meet 
this beautiful woman that everyone in his kingdom
 was talking about. The prophet went to his 
wife and said “The king wants to meet you” “Do not ever tell him that
 you are my wife, because I’ve told him that 
you are my sister” the prophet told his wife. When Sarah went to the
 King’s palace,  the king was struck by her beauty, and he tried to take hold of
 her with his hands! But the moment his hand
 got near Sarah, it became stiff, and he 
could not move it!! The king was scared that he 
requested Sarah “Please pray to Allah (swt) for me, and I will never harm you” When Sarah prayed to Allah (swt),  his hands got cured miraculously!! But the moment he realized that 
his hands were cured, the foolish king tried to take
 hold of Sarah again!! And for the second time, 
his hands got stiff. The king couldn’t move
 his hands at all!! “Please pray to Allah (swt) for me.. I shall never harm you again!”
said the king. Sarah prayed to Allah again, and his hands got cured 
for the second time. This time the King realized that Sarah was no ordinary woman. So he gave Sarah a gift! He gave her one of his Egyptian
 maid servant, and her name was Hajar! When Sarah returned home, the prophet asked her 
what happened? “Allah (swt) taught that
 evil king a lesson, and he gave me maid- Hajar”
 replied Sarah Years passed and the
 prophet grew old. His hair grayed, but he continued to call people
 back to Allah (swt). Sarah too had grown old, and she realized that she
 would no longer  be able to give birth to a child. So she asked the prophet to marry 
their servant Hajar. She then prayed to Allah(swt) 
to bless them with a child! After a few months, Hajar gave birth to a child, and they named him Ismail! By now, the prophet had 
grown very old! One day the prophet woke up, he felt like Allah(swt) wanted him
 to do something. So he went to Hajar. “Get Ismail”  
He said “Get ready for a long journey” Ibrahim (as) and his wife with the
 baby in her arms kept travelling for a long long time. They walked for many days till they reached
 a dry valley of the desert  near the Al-Marwah mountain. There were no fruits, no trees, no food, 
and no water either! No signs of any life could be
 found in the valley The prophet then left his wife and son with a small amount of 
food and water. This was hardly enough for both of
 them to last for two days!! The prophet then turned around 
and started walking away. His wife hurried after him “Where are you going,  leaving us in this barren valley?” she cried to him. But the prophet did not answer her, and kept walking away. She called him again,  but the prophet remained silent
 and walked away! Finally she understood that the prophet 
was not acting on his own.  She realized that Allah(swt) had 
commanded him to do this. ""Did Allah(swt) command you to do so?”  she asked him. The Prophet shook his head
 and continued walking. Then his great wife said “We are not going to be lost, since Allah(swt) who commanded 
you is with us” The prophet was very sad  as he had left his wife and his
 son in a barren desert, where there were no other people. He prayed to Allah(swt) to give his wife
 and son enough food. And he asked Allah(swt) to send people
 with good hearts to them Oh no.. Why did the Prophet leave
 his wife and son? Why did he do that? It was because Allah(swt) had
 commanded him.. Hmm.. What happened next? I will tell you the remaining
 story tomorrow. Ok baba. Before I leave,  let me ask you a few questions.  Are you ready? I am ready!! Alright. Now tell me why was the
 prophet thrown into the fire? Here are the options: Option A- Because He had smashed 
the idols they worshipped, Option B- He stole their idols, and Option C- He burned the idols That’s an easy one, The prophet was thrown in fire  because he smashed the idols the
 people worshipped! Masha Allah.. 
that’s the right answer. Thank you Baba How did the prophet challenge 
King Nimrod? The prophet asked the king if he could make
 the sun rise from the west! Isn't that right? That’s right again. Now tell me who accompanied the Prophet
 when he left Babylon The prophet's cousin Lut joined him, and another believer Sarah 
too accompanied him That’s very good! Hmm.. What was the name of the
 Prophet's first son? It was Ismail (as)!! Masha Allah..!
That’s right again! Its time for me to leave. Insha Allah..! I’ll tell you the remaining 
story tomorrow."
"(----Background Music----) (----No Audio----) Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! Are you ready for
the story Amir? Yes I am! I’m so excited!! Now listen carefully Bismillah (----Background Music----) The Story of Muhammad (pbuh) (---No Dialogue---) (---Nature Background sound----) The disbelievers continued to torture the
Prophet and His followers wherever he went (---Nature Background sound----) But the Prophet kept
preaching to the people, and He gained more
and more followers The most notable event
 that happened during  that time was the conversion of Umar(ra) He was one of the most rabid enemies
of Islam, and of the Prophet. He was a tormentor of the
Muslims, and everyone feared him It is said that one
day, in sheer anger, Umar(ra) resolved to kill the Prophet, and he left his home with this intention. As he approached the house of the
Prophet,  he was stopped by a man. When the man learnt what
Umar(ra) was upto, he told Him “Your sister and her husband
has embraced Islam too! Why don’t you go back to your
house and set it straight?” Umar(ra) was furious to hear
 that his sister and her husband had become Muslims. He immediately changed his direction
and set out to his sister’s house. As he approached the house, he could
hear the sound of Qur’an being recited. Umar(ra) walked toward the house,
and knocked at the door. When the sister and her husband heard the
knock at their door,  they hurried to hide the books. Umar(ra) entered the house, and demanded to
know what was the humming sound he heard. Umar(ra)’s sister replied that it was the
sound of them talking to each other But Umar(ra) knew well
the sound of Qur’an. So he asked them angrily “Have you become Muslims?” “Yes, we have” answered the sister's husband. Umar(ra) was so angry
that he struck him! And when his sister tried to defend
her husband,  he hit her face too! Blood started drooling
from her face by now. Umar’s sister stood up and
faced her angry brother saying “You enemy of God! You have hit me just because
 I believe in God.  Whether you like it or not,  I testify that there no God
 but Allah(swt) and that Muhammad(saw) is His slave
 and Messenger. Do whatever you will!” Umar saw the blood running
 down his sisters face.  Her words echoed in his ears. He demanded that the 
words of Qur’an he had heard as he approached the house,  be recited to Him His sister asked him to wash 
clean himself up,  before she recited those words Umar(ra) agreed, he cleaned
himself and came back When his sister recited the words from
Qur’an,  His eyes were filled with hot tears! (----No audio----) “Is this what we are
up against?” he cried “The one who has spoken these
words needs to be worshipped” (----No dialogue---) Umar(ra) left his sister’s house,
and rushed to the Prophet (----Sound of riding the hourse----) Those with the Prophet were afraid
of Umar,  so they tried to stop him The Prophet asked him “ Why did you come here son of Khattab?” Umar(ra) faced the Prophet with
humility and joy and said “O Messenger of God,  I have come for no reason, except to say I believe in God
 and His messenger!” The Prophet was overcome with Joy, and cried out that God was great!! Umar’s conversion had 
a miraculous effect  on the people of Makkah. More and more people now
followed the Prophet. The disbelievers then made the life of Prophet even more difficult. They imposed a total ban on contact
with the Prophet’s family. The Prophet was forced to leave
Makkah on account of the ban. During this period, the Prophet and His disciples mostly
stayed indoors,  and Islam made no progress outside. During the sacred months, when people were
not violent,  the Prophet came out to preach. The ban on Prophet’s family was
 lifted after three years, and He returned to Makkah. (---Nature Background sound----) In the following year, His uncle Abu Talib and His wife
 Khadija(ra) died! The Prophet had lost His guardian
who protected him from enemies. And Khadija(ra) was His most
encouraging companion. After the death of his wife, Prophet married a
widowed woman,Sawda She and her husband had emigrated to Abyssinia in the early 
years of persecution. After her husband died,  she came back
to Makkah and sought Prophet’s shelter. The Prophet recognizing her sacrifices for
Islam,  extended His shelter by marrying her. (----Nature sound---) One calm night in Makkah, one year before the migration to Medeena Prophet  was sleeping when angel Gibreel
 appeared before him. He opened Prophet’s chest,  removed his heart, and washed it
 with ZamZam water. He then brought a vessel made of
gold containing wisdom and faith. He emptied the vessel into the noble chest
of the Prophet, and then closed it up. The Angel woke the Prophet There the Prophet saw a white animal,  smaller than a horse, but
larger than a donkey, with wings on each side of its hind legs. The Prophet mounted the animal and took
off to Bayt Al-Maqdis in Jerusalem. This part of the journey
is called Al-Isra (----No audio---) After dismounting the animal, the Prophet entered Al-Aqsa Mosque
 and prayed. He then saw His predecessors-
 Musa (as), Isa (as)  and Ibrahim (as) standing before Him! The prophet then went on
to lead them in prayers. The Prophet then mounted the animal again, and set out shooting into the heavens. This ascension is
known as Al-Miraj. The Angel led the Prophet to the Lote tree.  At this point of journey,  Allah spoke to Him directly,  and revealed to him the last verses
 of Al-Baqarah (----No audio----) It is during this miraculous journey,  that Allah(swt) made the daily prayers
compulsory, initially fifty daily prayers for the
 prophet and his followers (-----No audio----) After the Prophet received these instructions
from Allah(swt), He came down until He met Musa (as). (-----No Audio----) The old Prophet asked
 about the acts of worship Allah had prescribed for Him When the Prophet informed him
 about the fifty prayers the Old prophet said "" Your people will not be able
 to perform fifty prayers each day"" I tried the people before you- I had to deal with the children of Israel-  and it was very difficult for me. Go back to your Lord, and ask Him to reduce the burden on your people” The Prophet did as he was
told, and went back to God. Allah reduced it by ten. (----No audio---) But when He came by the Musa (as) again,  He suggested that He return to Lord, and ask for further reduction
for the same reason. (----No audio---) The Prophet continued to go
 back and forth  between His lord and Musa (as),  until Allah said  “There will be five prayers every day,  each being rewarded as ten, thus making it equivalent
 to fifty daily prayers. The Prophet then met Musa (as) once again, and informed Him of the five daily prayers. Musa (as) repeated that he should go
back again.  However the Prophet said “I have asked my Lord till
I am too shy to face Him. I accept this and submit to Him” On this journey the Prophet was
 taken to paradise,  where he saw dwelling made of pearls  and their soils made of musk. (---No dialogue---) He was also taken to Hell,  where Allah
revealed to him the scenes from future. He saw people receiving terrible
punishments for different sins. (---No audio---) The Prophet then returned home, and He found his bed still warm Islam started spreading rapidly
in the region after this. The disbelievers were
very angry with this. One day, leaders decided
to kill the prophet. They developed a plan in which, one man was chosen from each of their
tribes,  and they all planned to attack the
Prophet simultaneously. (---No audio---) An angel informed the Prophet
about their plans, and asked Him to leave Makkah immediately. The Prophet left with Abu Bakar(ra), on the same night He was 
to be assassinated. They went south of Makkah,
to a mountain cave of Thawr. After staying there for three nights,
they travelled North to Medinah. When the disbelievers heard
 about their escape, they put up a reward of 100 camels to
whoever caught the prophet. (---Nature sound---) But in spite of their best search parties  the Prophet arrived safely in Medinah. This event is known as the Hijra,  and the Islamic calendar 
begins with this event. The people of Medinah gave a
warm welcome to the Prophet. One by one, the people of Makkah
 left for Medinah, leaving behind their properties and homes. (-----Nature sound---) When the Prophet and His people
 settled in Medinah,  it was ruled by many
different tribes.  These tribes were constantly
 quarreling with each other. It was only when the Prophet arrived,
they had peace with each other. The tribesmen forgot their old feuds
and were united in the bond of Islam. The Prophet in order to unite
everyone in closer bonds,  established between
 themselves a brotherhood. The first step the Prophet took,
 after settling in Medina,  was to build a Mosque for
 the worship of Allah. Then the Prophet made a
 charter to make all the  different people live together
 in an orderly fashion, clearly defining their rights
and obligations. This charter represented the 
framework of the first commonwealth organized
 by the prophet. After His emigration to Medinah, the enemies of Islam increased their
 assault from all sides. The Battle of Badr, Uhud
were fought near Medinah The fame of the Prophet had
by now spread far and wide. Many delegations from all parts of
Arabia came to visit the Prophet When they learned the
 teachings of the Prophet,  they were impressed and became
followers of the prophet. (---No Audio---) The Prophet also sent many
 of His companions, who knew Qur’an by heart, to new lands. They were sent to preach Islam
to the people living there He also wrote letters to several Kings
and rulers, inviting them to Islam (----Nature sound----) Neguas, the King of Abyssinia was among
the first rulers to who accepted Islam. This was followed by many
other kings and rulers About two years later, 
at the end of 629CE the disbelievers violated the terms and
attacked the followers of the Prophet The men who managed to escape
 took shelter in Makkah, and sought the help of the
 Prophet to save their lives. The Prophet received their message, and
He confirmed all the reports of attack. The Prophet then marched toward the
Makkah, with three thousand men!. By the time He arrived outside Makkah,  His followers from neighboring
lands had joined Him, and there were more than
 ten thousand people now! Before entering the city,  He sent word to the citizens of Makkah tha
t anyone who remained in His home,  or Abu Sufyan’s home,  or in the Kab’ah would be safe. The army entered Makkah without fighting  and the Prophet went directly
 to the Kab’ah He magnified Allah for the triumphant
 entry in the Holy city. He then pointed at each idol with a stick
he had in his hand and said “Truth has come and Falsehood will neither
 start nor will it reappear” (---No Audio---) And one by one, the idols fell down. The Kab’ah was then cleansed by the removal
of all three hundred sixty idols,  and it was restored to its
pristine status. (-----No Audio----) The prophet then stood by the
 Kab’ah and said  “O disbelievers, what do you think I am
 about to do with you?” “You are a noble man,
son of a noble brother” The Prophet forgave all of them saying  “I will treat you as Prophet Yusuf
treated his brothers.  There is no reproach against you. Go to your homes, and you are all free” The people of Makkah the accepted
 Islam including the staunch enemies of the Prophet. Few of His enemies had fled the city
 when the Prophet made his entry.  However, when they received
Prophet’s assurance of no retaliation  and no compulsion in religion,  they came back gradually to Makkah. Within a year, 630 CE,  almost all Arabia had accepted Islam. The Prophet performed His
last pilgrimage in 632 CE. About One hundred and thirty
thousand men and women  performed pilgrimage that year with Him. (-----No audio----) Two months later,  the Prophet fell ill and after several days died on
Monday, 12 Rabbi al-Awwal, the eleventh year after
 Hijra in Medinah. Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) lived a most
simple, austere and modest life. He and His family used to go without
 cooked meal for days,  relying only of dates, dried bread
 and water. During the day, he was the busiest man,  as he performed his duties in many roles
 at once as head of state,  chief justice, commander in chief,
arbitrator and many many others. He was the most devoted
man at night as well. He used to spend one to two-thirds of
every night in prayer and meditation. The Prophets possession consisted
of mats, blankets,  jugs and other simple things even when
He was the virtual ruler of Arabia. (----Nature sound---) Mashallah! That was such a wonderful story! Aren’t you going to ask
the questions today Baba? Of course I am. Are you ready? Yes, I am! Alright.. Now tell me where did the
Prophet go after leaving from Makkah? Hmmm.. The Prophet
went to Medina! That’s the right answer! Next question- What was the first stop for
the Angel and the Prophet? Hmm.. they first stopped at
Bayt Al-Maqdis in Jerusalem. And do you know what this part
of the journey is called? This part of the journey
is called Al-Isra Mashallah, that’s correct. Now tell me the name of any
one ruler who accepted Islam Hmmm.. King Negus! And can you tell me when
did the Prophet die? The Prophet died on
8th June, 632 CE Mashallah! You gave me all the
right answers my son! Baba, aren’t there any other
stories about the Prophet? There are many many interesting
stories of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). I will tell you all of
them in the next days. Its getting late now  I will see you tomorrow. Good night my son! Good night Baba! (----Nature sound---) (----Background music---)"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Are you ready for today's story?  I cant wait to know what happened
 to them in the desert Hahaa.. So excited huh? Alright, let me start from where
 we stopped yesterday Bismillah! The test of Prophet Ibrahim (as) Prophet Ibrahim (as) left his
wife and his son  in a barren desert as commanded
by Allah (swt). He had left them with a small amount
 of food and water, that would hardly last
 for two days! He walked away praying that they would be
 found by good people. Hajar (ra) drank the water that the
 prophet had left, so that she could feed her son. The water got over very soon,  and both of them started
getting very thirsty. After sometime the baby started
 getting thirsty, and started to cry! She ran to a hill closeby
called Al Marwah hoping that she might find
 somebody. She stood there hoping to find somebody,
 but she did not!! Then she ran to the next mountain
called Al Safa, hoping to find someone from there! But she couldn’t find anyone
from there either! She kept running between these
 mountains seven times! When she climbed Al Marwah
 for the last time, she was very tired. She got so tired that she sat
next to her baby. It was then that she heard a voice She kept quiet,and waited to
 hear the voice again When she heard the voice for
 the second time, she said “O, whoever
 you might be, you have made me hear your voice! Have you got something to help me?” That was when she saw an angel
digging the earth! The angel kept digging till the
water flowed from it! It was a miracle! When she saw the water,  she ran toward it, and started to build a
 basin around it. She scooped the water with her hands
 and drank from it. Then she filled the water bag and
ran towards her child. This place where the water rose
 is called Zam Zam. After a few days, some people were
 travelling through Mecca. They saw the birds flying
around Al Marwah, and they thought the birds might be
 flying around the water. They started walking
 towards Al Marwah When they arrived, they were surprised to find a woman  with a baby sitting near the water! “Shall we stay here and
use this water please?” They asked her. Hajar(ra) said yes, and they drank water from
 the Zam Zam Like that many others came
 to Al Marwah,  and eventually settled down there. The whole valley became alive now, and she and her child were
 not alone anymore! Ismail (as) grew up and learned
 Arabic from the people who had settled down
 at Al Marwah. He was a good boy, and his virtues and qualities made
the people admire him. He kept thinking about his father, and knew that his father will
come back someday! Ismail (as) then married a local woman, and lived his life in peace. In the meantime, Prophet Ibrahim (as) was very sad because he had not seen his son
 for a very long time. One day, he decided to go to Mecca to
meet his wife and his son. He travelled for many days, and finally
 arrived at Al Marwah But it was very late. When he arrived,  people told him that Hajar(ra) had died sometime ago.  The prophet was very sad
 to hear this and then the local people told the
 prophet that his son, Ismail (as) was still alive! The prophet was very happy to hear this, and thanked Allah(swt)! When Ismail(as) saw his father, he ran to him and hugged
him very tightly. He could not believe his eyes!! He was very happy to see his father  after a long long time. It was a very happy time
for both of them But one day, Allah decided
 to test Ibrahim(as)  One night when the prophet
 was sleeping, he saw a dream! In his dream the prophet saw himself killing his son as a sacrifice
 to Allah (swt). The prophet woke up, and ignored it as it was
just a dream But the next night, he saw the same dream again!. This time he realized that this
was not just a dream, and that Allah(swt) was asking him
to sacrifice his own son! The prophet went to his son, and told him about the dream. Ismail (as) realized that it was an
order from Allah(swt) ""Do what Allah(swt) has asked you to” He told his father. The next day, the prophet took a rope
and a knife,  and set out for mount Arafat,
 along with his son. Upon reaching the top
of the mountain, Ismail (as) asked his father to tie
 his hand and legs, so that he may not struggle
during the sacrifice. The prophet obliged, and tied
 his hands and legs. Then he blindofolded himself so that he wont have to
watch his son suffer. The prophet raised his knife, but then suddenly, he heard the
voice from the sky. He took off his blindfold, and saw a sheep
 being sent from heaven.  Allah(swt) had sent the sheep to be
sacrified instead of Ismail(as) The prophet was really happy, because his son was going to be alive! The prophet and his son  had just passed a difficult test
from Allah (swt) Ibrahim (as) slaughtered the sheep,  and they had a big celebration. The prophet and his son kept calling
people to worship Allah(swt) They didn’t have any place to
worship Allah(swt) so one day Allah(swt) ordered the
prophet to build a house!! “Allah(swt) has ordered me to
 build a Kabbah” the prophet said to his son. And Ismail(as) replied “Do what your God has
ordered you to do”. The prophet then asked his son if he help him build the kabbah, and Ismail (as) agreed. They started building the foundation
of the kabbah. Ismail (as) brought the stones, while Ibrahim (as) built
 the house. When the walls got tall, Ismail(as)  brought a large stone for the
prophet to work by standing on it. This stone was called
Maqam-e-Ibrahim. When they completed the foundation, and built the corners, Ibrahim(as) asked Ismail(as) to find
the stone to fill the corner. “I feel tired” Ismail (as) said to his father. But when the Ibrahim(as) insisted,  Ismail(as) went searching
 for the stone. While he was gone, an angel got the
prophet a stone. The angel told him that this stone was brought to earth by
Adam (as) from Paradise! The stone was originally white, however its color gradually
turned into black  because of the sins commited
  by people on earth. Ismail(as) returned after sometime, and when he saw the stone. he was surprised and asked his
 father where it came from. “It was brought by someone who never
gets tired” replied Ibrahim(as) And they finally completed
building the Kabbah They prayed to Allah (swt) to
accept their work Allah(swt) was very happy with the prophet and his son for
spreading his message. And proclaimed the pilgrimage
among men, they will come to thee on foot, and on every kind of camel,  lean an account of journeys through deep
and distant mountain highways. The prophet grew old, and so did his wife Sarah. One day when he was sitting
outside his house, he saw three men coming
towards his house. The three men were actually
 angels sent by Allah (swt). The prophet welcome them
inside to have food. The strangers went in and 
sat down for food. The Prophet served them a
 roasted calf! But the strangers did not 
touch the food at all. The prophet started to fear.  Then the angels comforted
 the prophet and asked him not to
 fear at all. They told him that they were actually the
 angels sent by Allah (swt). They informed him that they
 came to his house to deliver a good news. They said that Allah (swt) was going to give them a son, and that he should name him Ishaaq. They also told him that his son
 would be a prophet. Sarah could not believe
 her ears! How could that be true” 
she wondered. “I am so old” Then the angels said, all things 
are possible with Allah (swt). And after a few months, Sarah got pregnant and 
gave birth to a child! The prophet named him Ishaaq(as), as the angels told him. After a few years, Prophet Ibrahim missed his 
son Ismail (as) badly,  so he went to see him. But when the prophet reached
 the house of Ismail (as), he was not at home. His wife came out, and when the prophet asked
 her about Ismail(as), she replied “He has gone in search 
of livelihood”.  He then asked her how was 
their living conditions, to which she started complaining 
about everything!  She complained that they were living
 in misery and hardship, and many other things. She was not at all grateful to the
 blessings of Allah (swt) The prophet realized that
 she was not at all a suitable wife for his son, so left her a message that his son
 would understand. “When your husband returns  convey my salutations to him” he said “and also tell him to change the
 threshold of the of the gate”. The prophet then went back 
to his home. When Ismail(as) returned home 
in the evening, he felt something unusual “Did anyone visit us today?” he asked her. She replied, yes, and 
passed on the message. When Ismail(as) heard the message,  he realized that it was his father who visited him that day, and he understood the message
 that he gave her. “It was my father, and he has advised me
 to divorce you. You can go back to your family” He told her.  His wife went back to her house, and Ismail (as)  married 
another woman. After a long time, Prophet Ibrahim (as) again missed
 his son badly, so he visited his new house
 once again. When he arrived, it was his new wife who 
answered the door. The prophet asked the same questions he had asked his former wife. But this time when she 
answered, the prophet realized that she was a 
very grateful and kind woman. She kept thanking Allah(swt) for the wonderful things 
going on around, and the prophet was very happy. “When your husband comes home, give him my regards” The prophet told Ismail’s wife. He also added “And also tell him that he should keep
 the threshold of this gate firm”.  He left after asking her to deliver
 this secret message In the evening, when Ismail (as)
 came back, he asked his wife if anyone
 had come to visit him. When his wife told him about the
 prophet and the message, Ismail (as) was very happy. “it was my father” 
said Ismail “and you are the threshold of the gate. He asked me to keep you
 with me forever” said the prophet happily!! Prophet Ibrahim (as) lived for One hundred
 and seventy five years! He lived a life full of trials but he had a strong faith in Allah (swt)!! The life of Prophet Ibrahim (as) teaches us to love Allah (swt)
 unconditionally. Even though there are more
 than 25 prophets mentioned in the Quran, Allah mentions only two prophets  ideal for whole humanity, and they were: Prophet Muhammed (as), and Prophet Ibrahim (as) Mashallah! That was such an amazing story! Hmm.. So you liked the story 
of Ibrahim(as)? I loved it Baba! Ha haa.. Alright, now let me ask you a 
few questions from the story. Shall I? Go ahead Tell me the names of the mountains that
 Hajar (ra) ran across? Hmmm.. They were Al Safa
 and Al Marwah That’s the right answer. Now tell me how the travelers found 
the prophet's wife.  I’ll give you three options. Option A) They saw animals running 
towards the mountain. Option B) They saw water flowing 
down the mountain. Option C) They saw birds flying 
above the mountain It was option C! Hmm..! The travelers saw the birds 
flying above the mountain! Haha..That’s 
right again! The next question. How did God test Ibrahim (as)? I know that one. God asked Ibrahim (as) to sacrifice his
 only son Ismail (as) And did he sacrifice his son? No! Just before the sacrifice, God told the prophet that 
he was testing him, and God send a sheep instead
 for the sacrifice Mashallah, that’s the 
right answer. You are doing great my son. Thank you baba Why did the color of the stone that the angels brought turn
 from white to black? Hmm.. It was because of the sins commited
 by the people on earth. Excellent! And now for the last question, what was the name of the second
 son of the prophet? It was Ishaaq (as)! Isnt that right baba? Yes my son, that’s the 
right answer. That’s all for today. Insha Allah! I will tell you the story of
another prophet tomorrow Which story are you going 
to tell me tomorrow? Insha Allah!I will tell you the story of
 Prophet Ismail (as) tomorrow Thanks Baba! Good night! Good night!"
"(----No dialogue---) Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! Will you tell me the story
of another Prophet Baba? (---- laughing----) I’m glad that you love listening
to the Stories of Prophets my son! Yes Baba, I do! Which story are you
going to tell me today? Insha Allah I will start telling you the story
 of the last Prophet God sent to earth-
Prophet Muhammad (Pbuh) Masha Allah, that is great! Now listen carefully! Bismillah (----No dialogue----) Story of Prophet Muhammad (Pbuh) (----No dialogue----) Muhammad (Pbuh) was born in Makkah,
Arabia, on 12 Rabi’ Al Awal . (----No dialogue----) His mother, Aminah was the daughter of
Wahb Ibn Abdu Manaf of the Zahrah family. (----No dialogue----) His father, Abdullah, was the
 son of Abdul Muttalib. His ancestors can be traced to the
 noble house of Ishmael, the son of Prophet Ibrahim (as). The Prophet’s father
died before he was born, and His mother took care of
Him till the age of six. By the time He turned six,
His mother too passed away. His grandfather Abdul Muttalib took
tender care of the orphaned child. (----No dialogue---) But the old chief passed away in the
next two years, and before His death, He put the little one in
charge of His uncle, Abu Talib (----No dialogue---) Prophet Muhammad(Pbuh),
grew up as an obedient boy. When He was twelve years old,  He accompanied His uncle Abu Talib
 on his journey to Busra. They travelled for many
months in the desert (----No dialogue---) When the he introduced Muhammad(saw) to
the monk, Bahira was very impressed. He then said to Abu Talib  “Return with this boy, and guard Him
against the hatred of Jews. A great career
awaits your nephew!” Abu Talib didn’t quite understand
what the monk had meant, his nephew was just a normal child! He thanked Bahira, and
returned to Makkah (----No dialogue---) After this journey, nothing special happened in the life of
 this young Prophet for a long time. But all authorities agree that He had
a great wisdom, manners and morals, which was rare among
the people of Makkah He was liked by everyone for
his good character and wisdom that He received the title of ‘Al Ameen’,
which means the faithful (----No dialogue---) Like every other child, He had
to do the chores in his family. His uncle had lost
most of his wealth, and the Prophet helped him by
taking care of his flocks. Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)
mostly led a solitary life. He was sad when he saw the sudden outbursts of bloody quarrels among
 the people of Makkah. The people didn’t
care about the law. The Prophet’s heart grieved when
he saw the misery of other people, and such scenes were a daily
occurrence in Makkah during that time (----No dialogue----) When the Prophet was twenty five years
old, he travelled once again to Syria. And it was here that He met
the love of His life- Khadija (----No dialogue----) Khadija was one of the most
beautiful and noble woman around, and she was from a
very wealthy family. But she was a widow. (----No dialogue----) Inspite of being a widow, many wealthy and prominent men in the
 society asked her hand in marriage But she rejected them all, as she
had lost the desire to marry again. It was only until Prophet
Muhammad (saw) entered her life. Khadija was looking for someone honest
who could conduct business for her. It was then that she got
introduced to the Prophet She learned that even though
He was an orphan and poor, He came from a noble family. This man was of impeccable moral character, and widely known as the most
honest man around. The Prophet soon started working for her, and set out for His first business trip,
followed by a servant (----No dialogue----) After they came back, she asked her
servant about Prophet’s conduct The servant amazed
her by his report! “This young man is the kindest I
 have ever seen” He said. “He never treated me harshly,
 as many others do!” “And when we were travelling in the
 desert under the scorching sun, there was always a cloud following us,
 providing us the shade!” Not only that, this new employee proved
to be a very good businessman as well! First he sold the merchandise
she gave to Him. Then with the profits, he bought other
merchandise, and resold them again, thus making double profits!! Khadija fell deeply in
love with the Prophet. Even though He was 15 years younger,
she resolved to marry this man. (----No dialogue----) The next day, she sent his
sister to this young man (----No dialogue----) “Why are you not married
yet” she asked Him “For lack of means”
He answered “What if I were to offer you a wife
 of nobility and beauty,  will you be interested?”
 she asked “Who is it”
He replied When she mentioned her sister, the
young man chuckled in amazement (----Laughing----) How could I marry her? She has turned down the
most noble men in the city. They were much wealthier and
prominent than this poor shepherd!” But the sister replied ""Don’t you worry,
 I will take care of it!” (-----No dialogue----) Not long after, the Prophet
married Khadija (ra). It was the beginning of
one of the most loving, happiest, and sacred marriages
 in all human history! (-----No dialogue----) This marriage gave Him
 the loving heart of a woman, who consoled Him,
 and kept alive within Him, a flickering flame of hope
when no man believed in Him. The Prophet lived a wealthy
life for many years after that. (-----No dialogue----) When the Prophet reached the age of 35, he
settled by his judgement a grave dispute, which threatened to plunge Arabia
into a fresh series of war It was the time for
rebuilding the Ka’ba. Every tribe who had gathered there wanted
 the honor of raising the black stone, the most holy relic. The leaders and men of each tribe fought
among themselves claim the honor. Then a senior citizen intervened
and he said to the people “You will listen to the first man
who enters through that gate” The people agreed, and waited
patiently looking at the gate The first man to enter the gate
was none other than Prophet Muhammad (Pbuh), the Al-Ameen!! (----No dialogue---) The different tribes sought his advice, and
after they finished, the Prophet ordered “Place the stone on a cloth. Each tribe shall have the honor of lifting
the stone by holding a part of the cloth!” The people happily agreed to this idea. The stone was thus placed, and the rebuilding of the House was
completed without further interruption! It was during this time that Usman,
Ibn Huwairith arrived in Makkah. He tried to tempt the people of
Makkah by using Byzantine Gold, and tried to turn the territory
depended on Roman government. (----No dialogue-----) But his attempts failed,  because the Prophet
intervened and warned the people of Makkah (----No dialogue-----) The Prophet always helped
the poor and needy as well. It is said that when his uncle,
Abu Talib, fell into bad times, the Prophet cleared all his debts
using his personal wealth. The Prophet also undertook the
education of his uncle’s son “Ali”, and brought him up. A year later, he adopted ‘Akil,
another one of his Uncle’s son. (-----No dialogue----) Masha Allah, that was
such an amazing story! I’m glad you liked it Amir When did the Prophet receive
the call of God Baba? (---- laughing----) That’s the story of
tomorrow my son. I’m so excited! Alright, now are you
ready for the questions? I am! (----No dialogue---) Tell me who was the father
of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)? (----No dialogue---) His father was Abdullah,
the son of Abdul Muttalib Very good Amir. And what was the
name of his mother? His mother’s name was Aminah When did the Prophet’s
father and mother die? The Prophet’s father passed away
 before his birth, and His mother died when He
was six years old! Masha Allah!
That was great! Now tell me who took
care of the Prophet? At first his grandfather took care of him, and later it was his uncle Abu Talib
who took care of him Why did the people of Makkah
call the Prophet ‘Al Ameen’? Unlike most of the people in Makkah
 during that time, the Prophet was of a
fair character, and very honorable. That’s why the people called him Al Ameen Excellent Amir, that was great! Insha Allah, I will tell you the remaining
story tomorrow!  Good night my son Good night Baba! (----No dialogue---)"
"Assalamu Alaikum ! Walaikum Assalam! Are you ready for the
story of the  Prophet my son? Yes Baba, I always am! Alright, lets not waste time. Insha Allah, I will tell you the
story of Prophet Yahya (as) today Bismillah The Story of Prophet Yahya (as) Yahya (as) was the son of
Prophet Zachariah (as). His birth was a miracle because he was born
of a barren mother, and an aged father. In the previous episode, we saw how
Zechariah prayed for a son earnestly. Allah responded to his prayers, and soon
the angels arrived with a good news! They informed the Prophet that Allah
himself has named the child as Yahya. When the Prophet asked for a sign, the angels said that he will not be able to
talk for the next three days! Zachariah (as) could not talk for the next
three days, just like the angels told him. He had to communicate using
gestures during that period! After a few months, the Prophet
was blessed with a baby boy. He named the boy Yahya (as). Even as a child, Yahya (as)
was unlike any other kids. In a world where children used to
 amuse themselves, Yahya (as) was serious all the time. Most children took delight
in torturing animals, but the young Prophet
was merciful to them. He fed the animals from His food,  and he ate the fruit or leaves of trees! Yahya (as) loved reading books
 since childhood. When He grew up, Allah the exalted
called upon him. “Oh Yahya, hold fast
to the Torah” He said Allah (swt) blessed him with
wisdom even as a child! Yahya (as) soon became the wisest and
most knowledgeable man during that time. Soon, Allah blessed him with abilities
to pass judgements on people’s affairs! He interpreted the secrets of religion,  he guided the people on
 to the right path,  and warned them of evil. By the time He reached his maturity, his compassion for people and animals
increased greatly. He called the people
to repent the sins Once it so happened that Zachariah (as) and His wife went
searching for Yahya (as)  who had been missing for many days. They kept searching, and finally found the
young Prophet at the banks of Jordan river. When they found Him,  they were taken
aback by His devotion to Allah(swt). On another occasion,  Prophet Zachariah (as) went searching for his son who didn't come home for three days. He then found Him sitting in a grave, which He had dug himself. Zachariah (as) was surprised to see the
 Young Prophet weeping. “My Son”
The old Prophet said “I had been searching for
 you everywhere!” “Why are you sitting in this
grave and weeping?”  He asked Him “O father” the young
Prophet answered. “Didn’t you tell me that the span between
 Paradise and Hell can be crossed only by the
tears of weepers? The old Prophet was surprised
to hear the wisdom of his son. “Weep then, my son” He said to Him, and they wept together! They say that Yahya (as) wept so
much that tears marked His cheeks! Yahya (as) found comfort in the open, and never cared about food. He sometimes ate grass,
leaves and herbs as well He slept anywhere in the
mountains of holes in the ground Sometimes during the night, the Prophet would walk into a cave
to get some sleep. The Prophet would be so absorbed
 in his prayers  that He would ignore the lion or other
 beasts living in that cave. He would never pay any heed to the animals, and would continue to pray
and sleep inside. The beasts easily recognized Yahya (as)  as the Prophet, and they would
 leave the cave. The Prophet would sometime feed the
 beasts from his own food! He would then satisfy himself with the
 prayers for his soul. He would then spend rest
of the night, crying and praising Allah (swt) When Yahya (as) called people
to worship Allah(swt), He made them cry out of
 love and submission! He arrested their hearts, with
the truthfulness of His words! It was during this time that a tyrant king
named Herod Antipas ruled over Palestine The King was in love with Salome, who was his brother's daughter, and he planned to marry
his beautiful niece. Even though it was a sin,  no one dared to oppose the king. The marriage was encouraged by her mother, and even the learned men in Palestine. They did this so that they could
earn the favor of the King But when Yahya (as) heard about the
king’s plans, He got really angry! He openly announced that such
marriage would be a sin! He summoned everyone and told them that
 He would never approve,  as it was against the Torah! The Prophet’s pronouncement
spread like wildfire! When Salome heard this,
 she got really angry! It was her ambition to rule
the kingdom with her uncle. That night, Salome plotted
to get the Prophet killed! The next day, she dressed provocatively,
and danced before the King. This aroused the King’s lust,  and he offered to fulfill whatever
she desired! At once she told the King  “I desire to have the head of
Prophet Yahya on a plate” “He has defiled your honor and
mine throughout the land. If you grant me this wish, then I’ll offer myself to you.” The king was bewitched by her charm,  and he agreed to her monstrous request! Yahya (as) was executed by
the orders of the King.. And His head was
brought to Salome The cruel woman gloated with
delight when she saw this! But their happiness
didn’t last for long. Very soon, the death of Allah(swt)’s
beloved Prophet was avenged. Not only Salome, but all of Bani Israel were severely
punished by the invading armies, and they destroyed the kingdom! Masha Allah! That was such an amazing story! I’m glad you liked it my son Aren't you going to ask
me the questions today? Yes my son, are you ready? Yes Alright, now tell me who was the
father of Prophet Yahya (as)? Prophet Zachariah (as) That was quick!  Now which tribe
did the Prophet belong to? The Prophet belonged to the
tribe of Prophet Dawud (as) Very good my son! Why were there marks on the
cheeks of the Prophet? The Prophet used to weep all the time,
and this made marks on His cheeks! Very good. Now tell me why did the Prophet
oppose the marriage of Herod and Salome? Salome was King’s nephew, and
marrying one’s nephew was a sin. That’s why the Prophet
opposed the marriage. Masha Allah, that was
excellent my son! Which story are you going
to tell me tomorrow Baba? Insha Allah, I will tell you the story
of Prophet Isa (as) tomorrow! Thank you so much Baba! Good night Amir Good night Baba!"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! What are you doing Amir? I was watching the ants Baba! They are so amazing! Why are you so impressed
with the ants? I don’t know..
Just look at them! In spite of being so small
creatures, they are so disciplined! They always form a line
while going anywhere, and they are all so hardworking! That’s true my son! Now tell me, have you heard the story
of Prophet Sulaiman (as) and the Ants? No Baba, I haven’t! Can you
please tell that to me? Inshaallah, I will tell you the story now. Come lets sit down on a rock here Now listen carefully! Bismillah! The Story of Prophet
Sulaiman (as) In the last episode, we saw how wise
 Prophet Sulaiman (as) was, even when he was a child. After the death of Prophet Dawud
(as), Sulaiman (as) became the King. He begged Allah(swt) for a kingdom such
as none after him would have. Allah (swt) granted
him his wish. Besides the wisdom, Allah(swt) had
blessed the Prophet with many abilities. He could command the
wind as he pleased And he could understand the language of
birds and animals, and even talk to them! The Prophet ruled
the kingdom wisely, and at his commands, they built huge
temples, fortresses, towes and palaces. Once, Prophet Sulaiman (as) and his
army, were passing through a valley, while going to Askalon While they were passing through the
valley, an ant saw the approaching army He then cried out to
warn the other ants “Run to your homes! Or else, Sulaiman and
his army will unintentionally crush you!” The Prophet was very
amused to hear this. “Even this small ant knows that
I’m a prophet!” He thought He then thanked Allah(swt)
for saving the ant’s lives! Sulaiman (as) had jinns and birds
serving in his army as well! They were all kept in order and ranks,
 and the Prophet demanded strict discipline among them. That is why he was very upset
to find that one bird, the hoopoe, was absent
without his consent. However, the bird soon appeared
to explain his absence. The little bird had been scouting in areas
where the Prophet had not yet scouted. “I have discovered something
which you are not aware of. I am coming from Sab’a
with important news” The Prophet’s anger subsided
and he became curious. The bird continued “Sab’a is ruled by a
 Queen named Bilqis who has plenty of everything,
even a splendid throne!” But in spite of all this wealth, they are
worshipping the Sun instead of Allah! The Prophet wanted to test if the
Hoopoe was saying the truth, so he sent a letter
to the queen. The bird carried the letter
to the kingdom of Bilqis The Hoopoe dropped the letter in front
of the queen and flew away to hide. The queen opened the letter, and she
read the greetings from the Prophet. The Prophet had also asked
her to submit to Allah (swt) The queen was very disturbed,
so she summoned her advisors. They told her that even though their
country had the strength to wage a war, they wanted her to arrive
at a peaceful settlement. Then they came up with an idea! They decided to send their messengers
 to the Prophet’s palace  on the pretext of carrying gifts. They asked the messengers to learn
about the Prophet’s army and kingdom! When the messengers arrived
 at the Prophet’s palace, they realized that Sab’a was nothing
compared to the Prophet’s kingdom! They were surprised to see the lions,
tigers and birds serving in the army! And when they walked
into the palace, they realized that Sab’a’s wealth was
nothing compared to the Prophet’s. Even the floors of the palace was
made of Sandalwood and Gold! Sulaiman (as) realized that the messengers
were here to gather information about him. When the messengers offered the gifts, they
were shocked to see the Prophet’s reaction! The Prophet told them “Allah has given
me enough wealth, and a large kingdom! He has even made me a Prophet” He then asked them not to open the covers
of the gifts, and to take them back. He also sent a message to the queen
warning to destroy their country, if she didn’t accept Allah (swt) The queens envoy returned with the
gifts, and gave her the message. They also told her about the
wonderful things they had seen. Instead of taking offence, she
decided to visit the Prophet. She asked one of the messengers to
 inform the Prophet  that she was on her way to meet Him Accompanied by her royal officials
and servants, she left Sab’a. When Sulaiman (as) heard that the Queen of 
Sab’a was on her way, he decided to test her. He asked the jinns standing before him,  if they could bring the throne of Bilqis,
 before the queen reached One of the jinns placed the throne
before him within the blink of an eye! He then had the throne  disguised to test whether the queen 
would accept it in its changed condition. When Bilqis arrived at the palace, she
was welcomed with pomp and ceremony. The Prophet then asked her pointing at
the throne, if this belonged to her Bilqis was confused. She looked at the
throne again and again. After much confusion, she said “It looks
so, it resembles mine very much!” The Prophet judged that she was
intelligent and diplomatic. He then invited her
to the great hall. The floor of this hall
was laid in solid glass! When the queen entered the hall,
she thought this was water. So she lifted her skirt lightly,
from the fear of wetting it. The Prophet then informed her that this
was actually glass, and not water! Bilqis was amazed! She had never seen
such things before! She realized that she was in the company
of a very knowledgeable person, who was not only a great ruler,
but also a messenger of Allah(swt)! When she returned to Sab’a, she understood
 that the sun which they worshipped  was nothing but one of Allah’s creations She repented, gave up worshipping the
sun, and asked her people to do the same. Sulaiman (as) lived amidst glory,
and all creatures obeyed him. His death like his
life was also unique! One day the prophet was sitting
 holding his staff,  overseeing the jinns working at the mine. The Prophet died sitting
in that position . For a long time no one was aware of
his death, as he was sitting erect! The jinns continued to work in the mine, thinking that the Prophet was 
watching over them. They kept working for
many days like this Many days later, a hungry ant began
nibbling at the Prophet’s staff. It continued to do so,
 eating lower part of the staff, until it fell out of the Prophet’s hand.  When the body was no longer supported 
by the staff, it fell down! Mashallah! 
That was an amazing story! I’m glad you liked it my son! Now shall I ask you
a few questions? Yes Baba, I’m ready Alright, now tell me what were the
special powers of Prophet Sulaiman (as)? The prophet to understand
the language of animals And… He could
command the winds!! Great ! That was right!
Now for the next question.  When the Prophet was marching
 through the army, did the ants think that Prophet would
 kill them intentionally? No, the ants realized that he
 was a Prophet, thats why he shouted that the Prophet
 may kill them unknowingly That’s correct again! Now tell me why did the
Hoopoe go missing? The hoopoe was scouting the
lands for the Prophet,  and it had found the kingdom of Sab’a. That’s right again! What was the message that the
Prophet sent to the queen of Sab’a? The Prophet sent his greetings, and also
asked the queen to submit to Allah(swt)! And did the queen
submit to Allah (swt)? Not at first! She sent gifts to
the Prophet hoping to please him. She asked the messengers to
find more about their army Why didn’t the Prophet
accept their gifts? The Prophet told them that he had received
 better gifts from his god,  and asked them to take it back Did Bilqis get angry when
her gifts were rejected? No.. It was then that she
decided to pay him a visit And what did she realize
when she met the Prophet? She realized that the Prophet was not 
only a knowledgeable person,  but also a messenger of the God. Mashallah! You gave all the
right answers today my son. I will see you tomorrow,
with another story! Good bye Goodbye Baba!"
"Look at the sun Amir, Isn’t it beautiful? Masha Allah,
it is wonderful! So, are you ready
for today’s story? Yes I am! That’s wonderful! Insha Allah, I will tell you the
remaining story of Prophet Isa (as). Now listen carefully! Bismillah! The Story of Prophet Isa(as)
 And His Miracles! Prophet Isa (as) studied
the Torah earnestly. He was a pious worshipper of Allah (swt),
and followed the rules of Torah strictly. One day, on the day
of the Sabbath, Prophet Isa (as) was on
his way to the temple. Prophet Musa (as) had commanded that
 one should dedicate Saturday for worshipping Allah (swt). However, the wisdom behind the Sabbath
 had long gone by now. The priests now made a hundred
things unlawful as they wished. Imagine this, it was
considered against the law, if a doctor was called
to save a dying patient! It was a sin to eat, drink
or even plait the hairs!! But the Prophet didn’t
care for their laws He plucked a fruit
to feed a hungry child When the Priests saw this,
they frowned in anger! He made a fire for the Old woman to
keep themselves warm from freezing air. This was considered to be a
violation of the Sabbath law! When the Prophet finally
arrived at the temple, He was surprised to find more than twenty
thousand Priests inside the temple!! All of them earned a living
from the temple alone!! Prophet Isa (as) was surprised that there
were more priests than visitors itself! Yet the temple was full of sheep and doves  which were sold to the people to be
 offered as sacrifices. Every step inside the temple
cost the visitor money. The prophet was sad to find the
Priests worshipped nothing but money. The Priests were acting as
if it was a market place! The prophet saw that the poor people  who could not afford the price
 of dove or sheep, were driven away like flies!! The Prophet was sad wondering why the priests burned such
a huge amount of offerings inside the temple, while thousands of poor
people were hungry outside?? It was on this night that the
two noble prophets  Yahya (as) and Zakariyah (as)
got killed by the ruling authority. That night, the revelation
 descended upon Isa (as).  Allah (swt) commanded the Prophet to begin
 his call to the people of Israel. The simple life that the Prophet had
been living till now, was over. The page of worship and struggle
was opened in the life of Isa (as) Like an opposing force, Isa (as)
denounced the current practices, and reinforced the
law of Musa (as). The Prophet asked His people to lead a
simple life by noble words and deeds. The Prophet tried to make the
 priests understand that the Ten Commandments have more
 value than they imagined! For instance, He told them that the
 Fifth Commandment doesnt not only prohibit physical killing, but all forms of killing; physical, psychological
or spiritual His teachings annoyed
the priests, for every word of the Prophet
was a threat to their position, their misdeeds were
getting exposed The Priests started to
plot against the Prophet. One day, they arrested a
woman accused of adultery. They then called Isa
(as) to ask His opinion. They were actually planning to embarrass
the Prophet in front of the people. According to Mosaic law, a person involved in adultery
had to be stoned to death. The Priests knew that the Prophet
would oppose killing this woman, and thereby the Prophet would end
up speaking against the Mosaic law. They brought the adultress in
front of Isa (as), and asked him “Doesn’t the law stipulates the
stoning of the adultress?” “Yes” the Prophet replied. He then looked at the Priests
and the people standing around. He knew that they were more sinful than
this woman who was trying to earn a bread. He realized that if He
speaks against the Priests, then He would be held in contempt of
Mosaic Law. He now understood their plan. The Prophet then smiled and spoke
loudly to the people standing around “Whoever among you is
sinless, can stone her” The priests were
surprised to hear this! The people standing
around hesitated! No one present there
dared to stone her, for they were all sinners. There was no one eligible,
for no mortal can judge sin, only Allah(swt) the Most
Merciful can judge! The Prophet had made a new
law on adultery that day! As the Prophet left the temple,
the woman followed Him. The Prophet realized that
He was being followed, so He stopped and asked her
why she was following Him The woman remained silent, and took out
a bottle of perfume from her garment. She knelt before the Prophet, and washed His feet with the
perfume and her own tears! She then dried His
feet with her hair! Isa (as) was touched by her action,
and He asked her to stand up. The Prophet then
looked up and prayed “O Lord, forgive her sins!” Prophet Isa (as) continued to pray
to Allah for mercy on His people. He taught His people to show mercy on one
another, and to believe in Allah (swt) Once He told His followers “I sleep while I have nothing,
and I rise while I have nothing, and yet there is no one on
earth who wealthier than me!” Prophet Isa (as) once walked by a man
who was blind, leprous and paralyzed. The Prophet heard him saying “Praise be to Allah (swt) who has protected me from the trials
which He afflicts majority of men!” The Prophet stopped
walking and asked him “Tell me which trial do you
remain to be afflicted with? You are blind, leprous
and paralyzed!” But the beggar replied
“He protected me from a trial,  which is the greatest of all trials-
and that is disbelief!” The Prophet was happy
with this poor old man. He stepped forward, and placed His
hand on the poor man’s shoulders It was a miracle! As soon as the Prophet touched
the man, his diseases cured, and he was able to stand up!! Allah(swt) even transformed him, that
his face now shone with beauty!! The old man sought permission from the
Prophet to accompany Him, and He agreed. The Old man became a companion of Prophet
Isa (as) and started worshipping with Him! Masha Allah That was such a great story! I’m glad you liked it my son! Are you going to ask
me questions today? Yes, I am. Are you ready? I am ready! Alright Why were the Priests angry at
Prophet Isa (as) on the days of Sabbath? It was because the Prophet fed a hungry
child, and made fire for an old woman! That’s very good Amir. Now tell me why was the Prophet
sad when He entered the temple? The Prophet saw that there were more
 number of priests in the temple, than the visitors. The temple was like a marketplace, where the Priests charged
 money for everything. Anyone who came to the temple without
money were not allowed to stay Masha Allah, that is
the correct answer! Very good Amir Thank you Baba! Now tell me why did the poor
woman follow the Prophet? The woman followed the Prophet
because He had just saved her! And how did she repay her debt? The woman washed the Prophet’s feet
with perfume and her own tears! Then she wiped His feet
clean with her hair And what was the next miracle
performed by the Prophet? The Prophet healed a leper! Masha Allah, you gave me all the
right answers my son! I will tell you another
story tomorrow, Good night son Good night Baba!"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Waalaikim Assalam Inshallalh, today I will tell you what
happened to Yaqub (as) after he married Rahel! Thank you so much ! I was wondering what happened to them all day!  You are so excited!
Now listen very carefully! In the last episode you saw
how Prophet Yaqub (as) reached the land of Haran, and married the daughters
 of his uncle Laban. His first wife, Leah gave birth to
seven sons and a daughter as well! But Rahel, his second wife,
 and whom the Prophet  was very fond of,
 was sad as she didn’t have a son.
She prayed to Allah, who heard her call and
responded to her prayer! She then gave birth to a very
beautiful son, and they called him Yusuf! Yaqub (as) stayed in
Haran, and continued working for Laban
for Twenty years! One day, the prophet met
his uncle and asked him to let him go and
visit his family. “I have been blessed because of you” Said Laban. “Ask for whatever you need”. “Give me each speckled,
 spotted and black lambs that will be born this year”
 said Yaqub (as) Laban agreed, and the prophet
walked away happily. But Laban was not willing to part
 with the sheeps he owned,  even though it was Yaqub (as)
who took care of them He asked his sons to take away
 all the speckled, spotted and black sheeps
 from the flock. When Yaqub (as) had gone
 out for work,  the sons of Laban came and
they took all the speckled, spotted and
 the black sheeps away! When Yaqub (as) returned
that evening,  he realized that he had been
tricked by his uncle. But inspite of Laban’s tricks,
when the sheep bred, many of them were born black!!
This was a miracle!! When Laban saw this,
he was both surprised and angry at the prophet, as he had
 promised all the black lambs to Yaqub (as) One day, Allah (swt) asked
 the prophet to return to his country. The Prophet told his wives and children,
and prepared to leave Haran.  He took everything that
belonged to him, including the spotted and
black lambs. The prophet did not tell Laban
 about his plans, and left without bidding
him farewell. The next morning, Laban
 realized that Yaqub (as) had taken all his belongings
 and left the land. He was very angry!
He took all his people  and started following Yaqub (as). They travelled for many days
and nights following Yaqub (as) And finally, they caught up
with the prophet. “Why did you leave without
 my knowledge?” asked Laban. “If you had
 told me that you were leaving, we could have celebrated this
occasion with a feast. And I could have bid farewell
to my daughters as well” The prophet talked to Laban, and it
was decided that they will part ways. They sat on a hill called Galeed and
 they made a covenant there. It was decided that neither
 of them would enter the land of the other from that day! All of them then ate the food together. 
Then each bade the other farewell, as they departed, 
each returning to his own country. The prophet and his family walked then 
started travelling towards his country One day, at the break of the dawn, 
Prophet was sitting outside his tent, when an angel appeared before
 him in the shape of a man! Then the angel started to wrestle 
with the Prophet!! They fought neck to neck until 
the angel injured the prophets thigh, and the Prophet became lame! The sun had started rising up by now, and 
the angel asked him “What is your name?”  “Yaqub” replied the prophet. “From this day, you shall be called 
Israel” said the angel, and vanished into thin air!! The Prophet could not believe his eyes, 
and he realized that the man was actually an angel!! They then continued travelling 
for many days. When the Prophet reached the land of Seir, 
he sent a messenger ahead to Esau, asking forgiveness. The next day, the messenger returned with 
the news that Esau was riding toward him, with some 400 men!!! The prophet was afraid, so he prayed 
to Allah (swt) seeking his help. The prophet then prepared a great present 
for his brother! He asked his servants to take two hundred 
goats, two hundred ewes, thirty camels and many other animals along with them. 
He asked them to go ahead before him “When you meet my brother” he said
“he will ask you who you are. And you should say they belong to 
your servant Yaqub, and the animals are the present for his master Esau!” The slaves did as they were asked to 
and went ahead of the prophet. After two days, the prophet then travelled 
toward his country. Esau was riding with his men when he 
met the slaves of Yaqub (as). He was very impressed when the slaves told
him that the animals were a gift from his brother! When the prophet saw his brother coming, he
prostrated to him as a sign of salutation! Esau was quite moved when he saw this. 
So he ran towards him, and embraced him! Esau even wept when he saw his brother! “Who are these people with you? Asked 
Esau when he saw the women and children. “They were given to me by our God” said
the prophet humbly. Leah, Rahel, the children and all his slaves came and 
prostrated before Esau, 
as a sign of respect. Esau refused to accept the gifts at first. 
But the prophet insisted and 
he had to accept them at last. All of them started travelling back to
their country and they were led 
by none other than Esau! On their way back, the prophet camped near 
Jerusalem. It was here that the prophet
had poured the oil on a rock years ago!! He then built a mosque as he had promised! The Prophet then travelled to Hebron and 
met his father Prophet Ishaq (as). The Old Prophet was really happy when he 
met his son after a long time! Prophet Ishaq (as) died after sometime, at
the age of one hundred and eighty years old And they buried him next to their 
grandfather Ibrahim (as). Prophet Yaqub (as) had twelve sons in 
total, and Yusuf was one among them. 
He grew up into a handsome and devoted man. They migrated to Egypt, and they lived 
there for seventeen years! And after living and preaching about God 
for a long time, the prophet died at 
the age of one hundred and forty seven! Mashallah! It was such a great story!
I’m glad you liked it my son! Now shall I ask you a few questions from 
the story? I’m ready!! Ha haa.. 
Very good! Now here is the first question. Who was the uncle of Prophet Yaqub (as), 
who lived in Haran? Haa! I know the answer! It was Laban Mashallah! That’s correct! Who did the prophet fell in love with?
The prophet fell in love with Rahel!
That’s correct again. Now tell me what did the prophet ask 
his uncle before returning home? The prophet asked for all the speckled, 
spotted and black sheep from 
the from the herd. That’s right again!
What was the name that Angel gave 
the prophet, after wrestling with him? It was Israel! That’s correct
Who was the prophet’s favourite son? Hmm.. It was Yusuf (as) That’s right again! 
And now for the last question.
How old was the prophet when he died? The prophet was One hundred and 
forty seven years old when he died. Mashallah! You gave me all the right 
answers my son! 
You are such a brilliant boy. Thank you Baba That’s all for today,Inshallah I will tell
you the story of Prophet Shuaib (as) tomorrow.
Good night my son! Good night Baba.."

"Hey this is Jack Hartmann again And I thought I'd try to show you the best I can On kind of the meaning and the way we're explaining to do the sign language
I'm not the expert, but I've taken lessons from people that
are experts in signing And I'll do the best I can
As we do the 1 You put your one pointer finger like this
This is really meaning in the song what I'm saying one small So just pointer finger up
One small Voice
You put your fingers like this It looks like the letter what boys and girls? It looks like the letter v
And the v is the first letter in the word voice
And your voice comes out of your throat So put the v at the bottom of your throat
and you're going to do voice You're going to slide it up your neck or up
your throat This is voice
One small voice Singing comes from your heart
The way you feel, singing out a song comes from your heart and goes out to the world
So your hands go out like this Singing out a song and singing sweet
Sweetness or love comes from your heart Where's your heart? Right over here
Put your hand over your heart And you can show the expression on your face
too A real sweet smile, say sweet
Sweet Strong you're gonna take your 2 arms and put
your hands in fists And you're gonna kinda pump up, tighten up
your arms and muscles and say strong Strong like this
So sweet, like this And strong
What you do for one by one is you take 1 pointer finger like this
One by one, just take them back here and do this
One by one they'll grow And it means like, not a flower growing but
all the people singing and the children's voices will grow and these
are all the voices and the children and the people and they'll grow like this
They will come together and grow Together is easy
Put your hands together, your thumbs up and go around like this in a circle
And together Sing along your going to do singing from your
heart again And it goes out, sing along like this
That's a cool one, sing along And all the world
Oh, the world's a cool one Put your hands like this, put your thumbs
together In front of you like of like that
And put your hands like you have the globe, the world
And your putting like a circle, the Earth Your putting your hands like this
All the world and then your making like your hands go around the globe and your 2 pinkies
come together like this I've got the microphone here but right in
front of you like this Together all around the world like a circle
All the world will be singing Remember how to do that? From your heart, will be singing
Like this That is wonderful, you practice that and I'm
still learning too And if you want to learn more boys and girls

"Assalamu Alaikum Walaikum Assalam! So, are you ready for today's story? Yes, I'm. Alright! Inshallah, I will tell you the remaining
story of Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha) Bismillahirrahmanirrahim! The Story of Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha) Prophet Muhammad
 (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) had been married to
Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha)  for 15 long years by now. She was the first person to accept Islam. She knew that her husband would speak only the truth, and she trusted him. One day angel Jibril(Alaihissalam) taught the Prophet how to
perform the wudu. The he taught the prophet
how to say the salah. When the Prophet learned this, he taught this to
Khadija(Rali Allahu Anha) as well. From that day, they started to pray
in their own house. Ali Ibn Abu Talib, the cousin of Prophet
Muhammad (Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) was staying at their house and he saw them praying together. He was only 10 years old,  and he was curious to know
what they were doing When he asked, the Prophet told him that they were
 offering their prayers, or salah.  The prophet Muhammad
(Sallalahu Alaihi Wasallam) told the boy that Allah (Subhanahu wa ta'aala)
had made him a Prophet and revealed the Quran to him. The next day, Ali met the prophet and said ""‘I want to accept islam and
 follow its teachings” Prophet accepted this request gladly. Thus Ali became the second
follower of Islam after Khadija. They continued to pray together
from that day onwards.  The Prophet led the prayers and
Ali would stand next to Him. Khadija stood behind them Many days passed by,  and one day the angel
appeared again to the Prophet. The angel informed that it was
now time to call the people to Islam. He asked the prophet to preach the
message of Islam to the people. It was the dawn of a new era. The Prophet started
 calling people to Islam. He gave his full time attention in
preaching people about Islam. Preaching Islam was not an easy job.  But Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha)
supported her husband whole heartedly. She gave up her entire fortune
for the good cause of Islam. She got quite involved in her
 husband's work as well. She met people and talked
to them about Islam. Slowly and steadily people realized
that the Prophet was speaking the truth.  They started joining Islam one by one. But not everyone liked
what they were hearing, especially the Quraysh men. The Quraysh tribe were mainly
the leaders of Makkah. Most of the rich men in Makkah
belonged to the Quraysh tribe. They were scared that if people
started following Islam, then would no longer
 be feared and respected. They started treating the prophet
and his followers very cruelly.  They threw garbage at the prophet
whenever he passed by,  started beating those who
 was following the prophet,  and even chased some of
them out of Makkah. Several kinds of ban were
imposed on the Muslims. They were not allowed to take
part in their gatherings, and refused to do business with them. One day the prophet was sitting
on top of Hira mountain. He had been sitting there
for a long time now. When he did not reach
home at his usual time, Khadija started to worry about him. She asked one of the men to
 go and look for him in Makkah But after a while, the man returned. He couldn’t find the prophet
anywhere in Makkah. Khadija waited for some more time, but the prophet didn’t return. She decided to go and search
for the prophet herself. She carried some food and water with her. The Prophet had been in the
company of Angel Jibril(Alaihissalam) The angel said to the prophet  “Your wife is on her way here. She has got food and water for you.  When she arrives, tell her that there will be a house
made of pearls for her in paradise.” Like the Angel said, Khadija soon reached the cave. The prophet saw that she was carrying
food and water with her! Then the prophet told her about
 the angel’s message Khadija calmly replied  “May Gods peace and blessings
be upon you, Rasulullah” The Prophet had started
gaining many more followers.  When the Quraysh leaders saw this,
they were very angry. They imposed social boycott on
the Prophet and his family. Abu Lahab, the uncle of the Prophet,
was also the leader of Quraysh in Makkah. He was a very evil man,
 and the worst enemy of Muslims. He ordered a complete ban on the
Prophet’s family and their followers. No one in Makkah was allowed to
 buy or sell anything to them. They were not even allowed to talk to them. It was very difficult in those
days for someone  to live without the support
of their tribe. For three long years, the Prophet labored
quietly to deliver the message of God. Idol worship was deeply rooted
among the people,  and the Prophet tried to
 convince as much as He could After three years of struggle, He was only able to
secure thirty followers! Even His companions had now
started questioning His sanity! By now His enemies had started
 plotting against the Prophet The Prophet preached that everyone
were equal in front of God, and this challenged the
authority of local priests! One day, they gathered together and decided to suppress the movement of Prophet. They decided that each family
should take upon themselves the task of stamping out the
 followers of Islam. Each household started
torturing its own members,  relatives and slaves who were
following the Prophet. The people were beaten, flogged and
then thrown into the prison The hill of Ramada and the
 place called Bata had now become scenes of cruel torture. Only the Prophet was left out, because He had the protection of
Abu Talib and Abu Bakr (Rali Allahu Anhu) Then the priests tried to tempt the
Prophet into joining their religion.  For this, they sent Utba Ibn Rabi’a
to meet the Prophet “O son of my brother” said the messenger  “You are distinguished by your qualities. Yet, you have denounced our Gods.  I am here to make a proposition to you” “I am listening to you, O son of Walid”
said the Prophet. “If you are willing to acquire
 riches, honors, dignity, then we are willing to offer you a fortune larger than what we have among ourselves. We shall make you our chief,  and we will consult everything with you.  If you desire dominion,
then we shall make you our king” said Utba When Utba had finished, the Prophet said  “Now listen to me Son of Walid” “I’m listening” replied Utba The Prophet recited the first thirteen
 verses of Surah Fussilat He praised Allah (Subhanahu wa ta'ala), and explained about the
glad tidings of paradise to anyone who believed in the one true god. The Prophet then reminded him about what had happened to the
people of ‘Ad and Thamud When the Prophet had finished
His recitation, he said to Utba “This is my reply to your proposition. Now take what course you find the best” When their plan to tempt
the Prophet failed,  they approached His uncle- Abu Talib The Prophet’s uncle tried persuading the
Prophet to stop preaching to the people But the Prophet said  “O uncle! if they were to put
 the sun in my right hand, and the moon in my left hand  to stop
me from preaching Islam, I would never stop!” The Prophet, overcome by the thought that
His uncle was willing to desert Him, turned to depart from His home. But Abu Talib called out
to the Prophet loudly. He asked Him to come back. When the Prophet came back, Abu Talib told Him “Say whatever you please.  By the Lord, I shall not
desert you forever! Thats all Abu. Next time, I will tell you another story. Thanks, Ma-assalam Yusuf uncle! May Allah bless you! Massalam Abu!!"

"Muhammad (s) young Life
At the age of fifteen, Muhammad (s)’s tribe Quraish was involved in a serious fight with
the other tribes. Muhammad (s) was also involved in that fight. His job was to pick up the enemies’ arrows
and gave it to his uncles. Many people died during that fight. After that horrible fight all the tribes decided
not to fight each other for any foolish excuses anymore. So everybody agreed with that and created
a peaceful group where there were all united. They named it Hilf al-Fudul. Muhammad (s) was very active in Hilf al-Fudul
to bring peace in Makkah and establish human right in the society. One time a guy came to Makkah to sell some
items for his business. One of the bad guys from Makkah bought some
items from that salesman but did not pay his money. The salesman tried in many ways to collect
his money. He even went to many people so they could
help him but no one helped him. Then he went to the mountain top and began
to complain about the trouble. Then one of the Hilf al-Fudul member heard
his complain and helped him to get his money. Animal: So, did he has any special job in
his childhood? Muhammad (s) did not has any specific job
since he was young, but sometime he used to work as a shepherd, animal caretaker, for
some people. At the age of 25 his life had a new beginning. Khadijah (pbuh) was a rich noble business
woman. She was married two times but both her husbands
died. She had three children from her previous husbands. Many rich people wanted to marry Khadija (pbuh)
because she was a very good woman. But she refused them all. As business woman, she used to hire some people
as a business partner. At that time everybody know about Muhammad
(s)’s faithfulness, honesty and best behavior. Khadija (pbuh) thought he would be the best
business partner for her. She requested Muhammad (s) to be her business
partner. Muhammad (s) agreed to take her money and
go to Syria for business. The business was very successful. When he returned, he gave back her full money
and the profits. Khadija (pbuh) was surprised to see his successful
business style. Her people informed her about his good behavior,
honesty, deep thinking, sincerity and faith. She was very impressed to see Muhammad (s). She really wanted to marry him and told her
friend Nafisa about it. Nafisa immediately went to Muhammad (s) with
a marriage proposal. After talking with his uncle, Muhammad (s)
agreed to marry Khadijah (pbuh). At the age of 25 years old. According to most of the scholars, at that
time Khadija (pbuh) was 40 years old. Some historian also believe at that time she
was only 28 years old. But Allah (swt) knows the best. Animal: What Muhammad (s) gave to Khadija
(pbuh) in the wedding? At wedding Muhammad (s) gave 20 camels to
Khadija (pbuh) as a wedding gift. Because in Islam, man have to give a wedding
gift to the wife. In their wedding, all the chiefs of the Quraysh
tribe were invited, as well as everyone from his tribe of Banu Hashim were invited as well. Muhammad (s)’s uncle Abu Talib did all the
formalities in the marriage. At the wedding, Khadija (pbuh) gave a young
slave boy to Muhammad (s) as a gift. That young slave was Zayd (pbuh). Before he had become a slave, he was from
a very good family. However, one day he was with his mother and
while he was travelling, unfortunately some bad people caught him, and sold him at a slave
market. Later one of the nephew of Khadija (pbuh)
bought Zayd (pbuh) and gave him to her as a gift. At the time of Muhammad (s)'s wedding, Zayd
(pbuh) was only 15 years old and right away Muhammad (s) liked him very much, and he felt
like he was his own son. Zayd's family was searching for him for a
very long time. Finally one day they found him with Muhammad
(s) and requested him to give back their son. They were even willing to give money to him
as an exchange for their son. Muhammad (s) told them, that he was free to
go with his father and in return he did not want any money. But Zayd (pbuh) wanted to stay with Muhammad(s)
and did not want to go with his family. Muhammad (s) became very happy and told everyone
that, from that day, Zayd was his adopted son. Khadija was Muhammad (s)'s first wife and
while he was married to her, he did not marry any other woman during her life time. Animal: So how many children did they have? Khadija and Muhammad (s) had six children,
two sons and 4 daughters. In the order of their birth, the oldest was
Qasim, Zaynab, Ruqayyah, Kulthoom, Fatimah and Abdullah. When Muhammad (s) turned around 30 years old,
his uncle Abu Talib had a baby boy Ali (pbuh). Uncle Abu Talib had about 9 children however
he was not rich. So Muhammad (s) wanted to take care of Ali
(pbuh) to help out his Uncle. Ali (pbuh) loved Muhammad (s) very much, since
he was just like a father to him. 10 years after the marriage, when Muhammad
(s) was 35 years old, there was a very big flood in Makkah. The walls of the Kabbah were very old and
weak, since at that time it was still the original foundation, built by prophet Ibrahim
(pbuh). The walls were already weak, but the flood
made the walls even weaker and there were a lot more cracks. So the Quraysh decided to rebuild the Kabbah. But before rebuilding the Kabah, they needed
to break down the old walls first. The people were very scared to break the walls
since it was the Holy House. Animal: Oh.. So how they solved their problem? So, a good man named Waleed, encouraged the
people that they were not going to destroy the Kabbah, but rather they were rebuilding
the Holy house for the better. So they started their work. Every tribe in Makkah joined together to complete
the holy task. To build the Kabah, the people hired a Roman
man who was an expert to design buildings. Muhammad (s) also joined the work by carrying
the stones. It was a very joyful event for the people
of the Quraysh. But problem started to rise when the time
came to put back the black stone in its place. Every family and tribe wanted to put back
that holy black stone in its place. The crisis continued from four to five days. Different families were ready to fight each
other. At that moment, an old man gave an idea, saying
that whoever was the next man who would enter the gate of the Kabbah, that person would
decide what to do. Everyone agreed and waited for the next person
to come through the gate. As Allah (swt)'s plan, the next man that entered
the gate was Muhammad (s).Everyone was very happy to see him because they all loved him
very much. Animal: Really, he was going to solve their
big problem? But he was so young at that time. How did he solve their problem? He was always very smart to solve any kind
of problems. At that time, to solve their problem, Muhammad
(s) asked to bring a piece of cloth like a small bed sheet. Then he placed the black stone in middle of
that sheet. Next, he asked for all the head chief of each
of the family members to hold on to that cloth and lift up the stone to put it back into
its place. Muhammad (s) also helped them to push the
stone into the right place with his own hands. Everybody was very happy with Muhammad (s)'s
idea and avoided the big fight with  each other."
"Animals: Assalamu Alaikum. Yusuf: Walaikum Assalam. How are you children? Animals: Alhamdulillah, we are fine. We like to hear prophet stories from you. Yusuf: Ok, Mashallah. That's very good. The stories of the prophet are important for
all Muslims. Insallah, today we will learn about the first
part of Prophet Musa (pbuh)’s story. Are you ready for that? Animals: Yessssss. Yusuf: Ok, let start. Bismillah. Do you remember the story, when prophet Yusuf
(pbuh) and his family moved from their hometown of Palestine to Egypt? Animal: Yes. Yusuf: And who is prophet Israel (pbuh)? And who are the Bani Israel? Animal: Prophet Yaqub’s other name is prophet
Israel. Animal: And his children’s called Bani Israel
or children of Israel. Mashallah. In Egypt over the years’ Prophet Yaqub and
his children had a good life. The king treated them as his special guest
because of Prophet Yusuf (pbuh). After his death, slowly the children of Israel
were forced to become slaves to the Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt. During that hard time, with the blessings
of Allah (swt) the family of Bani Israel got bigger and bigger. About 400 years later one bad Pharaoh, named
Ramses started to rule the Egypt. He was very bad ruler. He forced his people and the children of Bani
Israel to obey him like a god. He even invented some gods for his people,
so they could worship them. One day the Pharaoh, the king saw a dream,
that a fire came from the Palestine and burned the Egyptian houses and idols, but there was
no harm to the children of Israel. After woken up from his sleep, he called all
of the smartest people to find the meaning of his dream. They said, a boy would be born in a family
of Bani Israel to destroy the Egyptians. Then he ordered to kill all the new born boys
to protect Egypt from Bani Israel. After few years, the pharaoh's advisers told
him that in the future he would not have any workers to do his job, because olds were dying
and new borns were being killed. So Pharaoh decided, one year he would kill
all new born boys and next year he would not kill any new born boys. Animal: He really killed new born baby boys? Why? Yusuf: So the boy, who would save the children
of Israel, could not born. But Allah (swt) is big planner. Prophet Harun (pbuh) was born in the year
when Pharaoh did not kill the newborn boys. But prophet Musa (pbuh) was born in the year
when pharaoh ordered to kill all new born boys. So the prophet's mother took care of him in
secret. She was very scared and did not know how to
protect Musa (pbuh) from the evil Pharaoh. Then Allah (swt) inspired prophet Musa's mother
to put him into a basket and float the basket into the Nile River. The mother had complete faith on Allah (swt). So she followed the order and let her daughter
to follow the basket. To follow Allah (swt)'s order, the Nile River
took the basket to the riverbank of king's palace. One servant found the basket with the baby
and took it to the Pharaoh and his queen. The queen was a believer on Allah (swt) and
she was very kind hearted. She did not have any children. When she saw the beautiful baby boy, Musa
(pbuh), Allah (swt) put strong love in her heart for the baby. She hugged the baby and requested her husband
not to kill him, maybe he would be good for them and keep him as their son. Pharaoh accepted his wife request. So they called few women to feed him but the
baby Musa (pbuh) refused them all. In the mean time, prophet Musa's sister informed
them about a woman who was good to feed the babies. They believed her and told her to bring that
woman. Do you know who that woman was? Animal: I know. That woman was the baby’s mother. Yusuf: Mashallah. That’s right. That woman was prophet Musa's mother. As Allah (swt)’s promise she got back her
child and the child started to drink his mother's milk. But Pharaoh was worried and asked her why
the baby only took her milk and refused others. She did not scare. She replied her milk was sweet and her milk
had sweet smell, so no child could refuse her. This answer satisfied Pharaoh. From that day she started to take care of
her son in Pharaoh's palace without being worried. One-day baby Musa hold Pharaoh's beard and
started to shake very hard. Pharaoh and his people did not like this action. They even though, he could be that baby who
will destroy the Egypt. So they decided to kill baby Musa. But Pharaoh's wife requested him not to kill
that innocent baby. So they put the baby in test. In front of him, they put one burn coal and
a beautiful pearl. If the baby would hold the pearl, baby was
smart and they would kill the baby. As Allah (swt)'s wish baby Musa hold the burn
coal and started to cry. That made Pharaoh calm. So Musa (pbuh) was safe and raised in the
palace as a prince. When he grew up, Allah (swt) gave him good
health, strength, knowledge and wisdom. One day, he saw an Egyptian was beating a
man of Bani Israel. He became very angry and hit the Egyptian
who died on the spot. He immediately realized that he just killed
a human, he became very sorry and begged forgiveness from Allah (swt). After that, he always showed more patience
and sympathy towards people. The next day he saw the same person from Bani
Israel involved in another fight with another Egyptian. Musa (pbuh) realized that the person from
Bani Israel was a troublemaker, so he became very upset on that Bani Israel. That person became scared to see Musa (pbuh)
and asked: “Would you kill me as you killed the Egyptian
yesterday?"" The Egyptian heard the news and reported it
to Pharaoh. One man came and inform him that he could
be killed for his action. He advised Musa (pbuh) to escape. Animal: Why he had to escape, he was a prince? Yusuf: At that time, the law for killing an
Egyptian was death. So, fearing the Pharaoh's men, he started
to run in the hot desert to find a safe place. After a very long walk, he crossed the desert
and reached a well outside the Median city where some of the people were watering their
animals. He was very weak because he had no food or
water. He took rest under a tree. After some time, he noticed there were two
sisters who could not water their animal. Musa (pbuh) asked them why they were waiting
for. The younger one said,
""We cannot push men."" Taking care of animal is a very hard job,
so usually man used to do that kind of jobs. Musa (pbuh) was surprised and asked, why they
were doing this job. One of the sisters replied,
“Our father is old and sick, so we do not have any choice.” Musa (pbuh) tried to help them to give water
to their animals. He saw that a very large rock was at the mouth
of the spring. It took ten healthy men to move that rock. But Musa (pbuh) was very strong man. So he moved the rock all by himself. After he watered their sheep, he put back
the rock in its place. He returned to the shade of the tree and asked
the help from Allah (swt) for his situation. The sisters returned home earlier as usual,
which surprised their father. They told him about Musa (pbuh). Their father sent one of his daughters to
invite him. Musa (pbuh) accepted their invitation and
told all about his situation to their father. Even about why he escaped from Egypt. The old man helped him:
""Don't fear, you have escaped from the bad king. If you want, you can stay with us."" Prophet Musa (pbuh) became happy because they
were good people and they were believers of Allah (swt). Animal: Was that old man a prophet? Yusuf: Some scholars say, he was prophet Shuave
(pbuh). But others say prophet Shuave came long before
then prophet Musa (as). Ibn Abbas (ra) said he was a good follower
of prophet Shuave (as). But Allah (swt) knows best. One of the daughters request her father to
give him a job to take care their sheep because he was very strong, helpful and modest person. Hearing that, their father requested Musa
(pbuh) to marry one of his daughter and work for him at least eight years but if Musa (pbuh)
could work ten years for him the old man would be happy. That was very good offer for Musa (pbuh). He married one of old man daughters and worked
ten long years for him. In this long ten years, Allah (swt) had a
plan to prepare him in the middle of the desert for his prophet hood. After ten years, Musa (pbuh) suddenly decided
to return to Egypt without any plan. His wife joined with him. On the way, they were lost but Allah (swt)
guided them to reach Mount Tur. At night, he saw a fire in the distance. To collect the fire, when he went there, he
heard a voice. That voice was from Allah (swt), the creator
of the Universe. In their conversation, Allah (swt) order him
to throw the stick which was in his right hand. As a miracle, that stick became a snake. Musa (pbuh) was scared to see the snake and
started to run. Allah (swt) told him not to fear and hold
that snake. As a miracle that snake turn into a stick
again. Next Allah (swt) told him to put his right
hand in his left side of clothes. Suddenly his hand became very white and shinny. After showing the two miracles to Prophet
Musa, Allah (swt) ordered him to go to his people and save them from the evil Pharaoh. Prophet Musa remind the accident of killing
an Egyptian man. He was scared to go to Pharaoh because Pharaoh
might kill him for that accident. Allah (swt) told him not to worry about that. Prophet Musa (pbuh) requested to improve his
ability to speak, his strength and to accept his brother Harun, English name Aaron (pbuh)
as a prophet. Allah (swt) accepted his request. Animal: Did Prophet Musa (as) had problem
to talk? Yusuf: From his child hood, he could not speak
clearly. Do you remember, Pharaoh tested him with a
burn coal and a pearl? Animal: Yes! Yusuf: Some scholars say, at that event he
put that burn coal in his mouth and burn his tongue. Other scholars say, he did not put that coal
in the mouth, by nature he had some problem to give clear speech. After his prayer, Allah (swt) solve his problem. But Allah (swt) knows best. Prophet Musa (pbuh) started his journey to
meet his brother Aaron (pbuh) in Egypt. When they meet, Allah (swt) guided them to
see the Pharaoh and convinced him about one and only God, Allah (swt) with a soft voice. Musa and Harun (pbut) went together to the
Pharaoh and talked about Allah (swt), the creator of everything. And advised him to worship Allah (swt) alone. The powerful king thought they were crazy. He asked them,
""What do you want?"" Musa (pbuh) request him to free the children
of Israel and let them go with him. Pharaoh asked:
""Why should I let go my slaves?"" Musa (pbuh) told him, they were not his slaves;
their owner is Allah (swt). He and his brother were the messenger of Allah
(swt). The Pharaoh told he saved him when he was
a child and took care him many years then he killed a man and escaped. Prophet Musa (pbuh) tried to convinced him
that everything was in Allah (swt)’s plan because he forced the children of Israel to
be his slave. The Pharaoh asked him,
“Who is this Allah?"" Prophet Musa (pbuh) tried to explain him about
almighty Allah (swt). But he was arrogant, he even threat Musa (pbuh)
that he could send him into prison. Prophet Musa (pbuh) showed him two miracles. He threw his stick and stick became a very
big snake. Then he brought his right hand from his left
side, and his hand became very white and shinny. The arrogant Pharaoh thought that was just
a magic. He talked his advisers and threw them into
the prison. Then he called all the best magicians from
the country to compete with Musa (pbuh) during a huge festival, where people came from all
over the Egypt. More and more people started to come when
they heard of that greatest contest between Pharaoh's best magicians and a single man
who claimed to be a prophet. Animal: Why Pharaoh thought that was a magic? Yusuf: During that time, Egypt was very advanced
in Magic. Best magicians were very respected by the
society. Before the contest began, Musa (pbuh) warned
the magicians not lie about Allah (swt)'s miracle. If they were not truthful, Allah (T) would
destroy them with a big punishment. That made them think, but they were greedy
for money and glory. They started their performance. First, they threw their objects on the ground. By magic, their object became snakes. People were so surprised to see that. Seeing that Pharaoh and his men became very
happy. Then Prophet Musa (pbuh) threw his stick. It became very large snake and ate all the
magicians’ snakes, one by one. Then he picked up the snakes and it turned
to stick again. People were amazed to see that miracle. All the magicians realized that Musa (pbuh)
was a true prophet of Allah (T). They immediately believed him and said,
""We believe in the Lord of Moses and Haron."" They fell down in prostration to Allah (T). The Pharaoh became very angry to the magicians
and threatened to kill them if they believed in Allah. But the magicians had strong faith on Musa
(pbuh) and Allah (T). So the Pharaoh ordered his people to cut the
magicians’ hands and feet from behind and hang them on the palm trees to kill them. But they showed their strong faith to Allah
(T) in front of thousands and thousands of people. Animal: What did the people do that time? Yusuf: The people did nothing. They stood by and watched that horrible event. If all the people believed in Musa (pbuh)
and protested against the Pharaoh, the Egyptian history could change. So, later they had to paid the price of their
action. Animal: How? After losing with Musa (pbuh), Pharaoh was
extremely upset. He didn’t know what to do. He called all his advisors. Before that day he established that he was
the Egyptian god. But in front of the people Musa (pbuh) proved
he was wrong. So he asked his chief minister Haman. Pharaoh: “Am I a liar?” Haman: “Who dared to tell you a liar?” To make the Pharaoh happy, Haman said, “Musa
is lying.” Then the Pharaoh declared his famous historical
line: ""O my people, I do not know, you have any
god, other than me."" Pharaoh ordered his people to make a tall
tower so he can meet Allah. When they realized it was impossible to make
such a tower, they tried to convinced pharaoh that he could not find any god at heaven because
pharaoh was the only god. Pharaoh became very happy. Prime Minister, Haman asked him, what they
should do with Musa and his people because they would convince other people not to accept
Pharaoh as their god. Pharaoh ordered his people to kill the Bani
Israel's sons, do a bad job with their women and to keep anyone in prison whoever complained
about them. Prophet Musa (pbuh) became very sad. He did not have any power to protect his people
from the evil Pharaoh. He requested his people to keep patience and
to asked help from their one and only God, Allah (T). In that difficult time, he had to deal with
a richest man of the Bani Israel. His name was Karun; his English name was Kora. He was very rich, used to live in a very big
mansion, and wore very expensive clothes. He had many slaves. He was such a rich that to carry the keys
of his treasure boxes, he had a group of healthy slaves. He treated very badly with poor people. Prophet Musa told him to pay tax or Zakat
to the poor because believers had to follow Allah (T)'s law. Animal: I thought Zakat is mandatory only
for Muslim? Yusuf: Rich people have to share some of his
wealth to the poor. That’s called Zakat. All prophets had almost same kind of law. As you know, Islam is not a new religion. It is same religion from Prophet Adam (pbuh). Karun did not like Prophet Musa's advice. He thought he was very smart, that's why Allah
(T) made him the richest person among Bani Israel. Prophet Musa warned him if he would not follow
Allah (T) order, Allah would put him in big punishment. After calculation he realized, he need to
pay big amount of zakat, so he refused to pay any zakat to poor and telling people that
prophet Musa invented new law about zakat for his own benefit. He even birded the people, so they say bad
thinks about Musa (pbuh). Allah (T) became very angry on him. So he opened the earth and swallowed him,
his mansion and all of his wealth, as if he never existed. Animal: That is very education for us who
don’t give Zakat to poor. Yusuf: Yes, it is. We always have to follow Allah (swt)’s law. One-day prophet Musa (pbuh) was teaching Allah
(swt) laws to his people. One of the Bani Israel asked him,
Man: Is there another man on earth that has more knowledge than your? Musa (pbuh) replied, no. Allah (swt) informed him, no man could have
all of the knowledge in the world. One man, named Khidr (pbuh) had some knowledge
that he did not has. Musa (pbuh) was interested to meet with him. Some historian say he went to Khartoum in
Sudan where Nile River split but Allah (swt) knows best. Allah (swt) told him to take a fish with him. Wherever he would lose the fish that was the
place, he would find Khidr (pbuh). The next day, he started his journey with
a young boy, named prophet Yusha (pbuh). They reached a place where two rivers met
and decided to rest there. Instantly, Musa (pbuh) fell asleep. Prophet Yusha (pbuh) saw the fish skip to
the river and it swam away. On its way, a hole was created and it looked
like a tunnel. He waited for Musa (pbuh) to get up to inform
him about the fish, but when he awoke, Yusha (pbuh) forgot to tell him. So they continued their journey for long time. When they became hungry, Musa (pbuh) asked
for the food. Yusha (pbuh) immediately informed him about
the fish. They went back to that place and found Khidr
(pbuh) lying, covered with a garment. They met each other. Prophet Musa (pbuh) wanted to follow Khidr
(pbuh) to learn some of his knowledge. But Khidr (pbuh) warned him, that he would
have to keep his patience. Musa (pbuh) promised to keep his patience
and not disturb him. So both of them started to walk along the
shore and got into a boat. They saw a bird drinking water from the sea. Khidr (pbuh) compared Allah (swt)'s knowledge
as the seawater and our knowledge is as little as the bird drinking water from the sea. Suddenly he made a hole in their boat. Prophet Musa (pbuh) could not keep his patient
and started to blame Khidr (pbuh). Khidr reminded him his promise and Musa (pbuh)
became sorry. They started to walk and saw a boy playing. Khidr (pbuh) held the boy and killed him. To see that horrible thing, Musa (pbuh) again
broke his promise and started to blame Khidr (pbuh) for his action. Khidr again reminded him his promise and Musa
(pbuh) became sorry. He also requested Khidr (pbuh) to give him
a last chance. They again started their walk to a village
and asked for some food from the villagers, but they refused. They were very bad people. Then they saw an old wall, which would break
any time. So he started to fix that wall as a free of
charge. Prophet Musa (pbuh) again broke his promise
and asked why he was doing free work for bad people, who even did not give any food to
them. Finally, Khidr (pbuh) told Musa (pbuh) to
leave him because he kept on breaking his patience. Animal: Why couldn’t Prophet Musa (pbuh)
keep his patience? Yusuf: Because he was the prophet of Allah
(swt), and every prophet's job was to stand against any kind of bad action. When prophet Musa (pbuh) saw Khidr (pbuh)'s
actions were not normal, as a prophet he immediately complained about his actions. Animal: Why did Khidr (as) do bad things? Did he explain to prophet Musa (as)? Yusuf: Yes, because Allah (swt) gave him special
knowledge to do his jobs. Before they separated from each other, Khidr
(pbuh) explained to prophet Musa (pbuh), why he did all that. First, there was a bad king, who started to
collect all good boats from the river. That boat's owners were very poor. To save that boat from that bad king he made
a small crack in it. Second, he killed the boy because, when he
would grow up, he would be an unbeliever and a very bad person in the society, even though
his parents were very religious and good people. Therefore, Allah (swt) decided to kill that
bad boy and give a very good boy to the parents who would take care his parents. Third, he fixed a wall with no cost because
the owners of the wall were two kids. They did not have a father and mother but
they were very good religious people. Under that wall, their parents hid some treasures
for them. If that wall would break, people would take
away their treasures. So Allah (swt) decided to protect their treasures
until they grew up. Animal: Wow, nothing he did was bad at all. It was very good! Yusuf: Yes, everything he did was for Allah
(swt)'s wishes. It was very good lessons for prophet Musa
(pbuh). Musa then went back to his people. When there were different miracles that were
proving the existence of Allah (T), the Pharaoh was afraid that he was going to lose his kingdom
because of Musa (pbuh). So Pharaoh and his advisors decided to kill
prophet Musa. The Quran says, one of his advisors did not
agree with Pharaoh. He was believer in his heart. He proved to Pharaoh that it was not good
idea to kill Musa (pbuh). Pharaoh: Why? Good Advisor: ""Because he only said, Allah
was one and only God. He even showed clear sign for his prophet
hood. If he lied, he would be responsible for his
lie. But if he was truthful and we kill him, Allah
(T)'s punishment would come to us."" Pharaoh was very angry with him but he was
very brave and warned them not to bring trouble to them. Later Pharaoh and his people planned to kill
that believer but Allah (T) saved him. Quran did not mention how Allah (T) saved
him. Prophet Musa (pbuh) repeated his demand from
Pharaoh to release the children of Israel from slavery. So Pharaoh called all the people from Egypt. In that big gathering, Pharaoh reminded them,
Pharaoh: “I am your god because I am rich and I am providing all your needs. However, Musa, he is poor, he does not have
gold. He doesn't even have angels who follow him."" People agreed with Pharaoh. They thought a leader should be rich and provide
all their needs. Therefore, they obeyed Pharaoh and ignored
prophet Musa (pbuh). The Pharaoh kept on refusing Allah (swt) and
killed the children of Israel. For his bad actions, Allah (swt) sent the
first punishment to Egypt, the drought. The water supply went low in the Nile River
and the land became very dry. They started suffering because their food
wasn't growing. But the Pharaoh remained arrogant. Then Allah (swt) sent the second punishment
for Egypt, a huge flood. Their land was under the water. They could not use their land for farming. When the Egyptians were in big trouble they
requested prophet Musa (pbuh) to save them from the flood. And they promised to believe in him and let
the children of Bani Israel go. So Allah (swt) removed his punishment from
them. So they started living their normal life. When Musa (pbuh) reminded them to fulfill
their promise, they refused and broke their promise to release the children of Israel. Then Allah (swt) sent the third punishment,
the grasshoppers, to destroy the Egyptian's crops. The grasshoppers ate whatever crops they grew. So they came to prophet Musa (pbuh) again
to remove Allah (swt)'s punishment and said that that time they would not break their
promise. So Allah (swt) removed their punishment but
they broke their promise again. Animal: Already Pharaoh and his people broke
their promises three times! Yusuf: Merciful Allah (swt) gave them more
chances to accept their true God. After that, Allah (swt) sent the fourth punishment
to Egyptians, the lice and spread the diseases. As usual, they again promised to Musa (pbuh),
then Allah (swt) removed the punishment and they broke their promise again. Then Allah (swt) sent the fifth punishment
for them, which was many frogs. They jumped on their foods, shared their houses
and started to give them lots of pain. They again promised to Musa (pbuh), then Allah
(swt) removed the punishment and they again broke their promise. Then Allah (swt) sent the sixth punishment
for them, the sign of blood. The Nile water was changed into blood. For prophet Musa and his people, it was just
water. But for the Egyptians, when they filled their
cup with water, it turned into blood. They again promised to Musa (pbuh), then Allah
(swt) remove the punishment and they again broke their promise. Each punishment was greater then it's previous
punishment so they would believe in Allah (swt) and follow his orders. But they kept continuing their bad actions. They always called prophet Musa (pbuh) a magician. Pharaoh became more arrogant, and he told
his people, Pharaoh: ""Am I not the king of this kingdom? And river flowing under me? Don't you see that? Am I not greater than Musa?"" Pharaoh even claimed that prophet Musa was
not good speaker. In this whole time only few young Bani Israel
accepted Islam openly, and the rest were scared to announce themselves as a Muslim because
of Pharaoh's cruel punishments. Musa and Harun (pbuh) build some houses for
their worship to Allah (swt). It was clear that that the Pharaoh would never
believe in Musa (pbuh) and he would never stop the torture the Bani Israel. So Musa (pbuh) prayed to Allah (swt) to Destroy
Pharaoh and his advisor's wealth and gave them a very painful punishment before they
believed in their creator Allah (swt). Animal: He was very arrogant. Why didn't he see the truth? Yusuf: Arrogant made him blind. Allah (swt) says in Quran, they are Deaf,
dumb, and blind, they will not return to the right path. After giving several chances to Pharaoh, Allah
(swt) decided to destroy him. This is the end of our first part of great
prophet Musa (pbuh)’s story. Inshallah, next time we will enjoy his second
part of the story."
"The people of 'Ad lived in the hills between
Yemen and Oman. They were physically well built and well-known
for their tall building construction with big towers. Among all the nation they were very powerful
and wealthy, which, unfortunately, made them arrogant. They had dictator who was an unjust ruler
and no one raised a voice against him. The people of Ad believed in Allah and worshiped
him but they also worshipped other gods and idols. This is one sin Allah does not forgive. To guide those people Allah (T) sent them
prophet Hud (pbuh). He was very strong and tolerant. He was the 3rd or 4th generation after Noah
(pbuh). Prophet Hud was telling his people not to
worship their stone idols which they made with their own hand. He requested his people to worship only Allah
(T). They refused his message and told him. Man: ""Do you want to be our master with your
call? What payment do you want?"" Prophet Hud (pbuh) said that he doesn't want
anything from them except for them to follow the truth. Hud tried to speak to them and to explain
about Allah's blessings: how Allah (T) had given them their strength and power. Hud's people looked about them and found they
were the strongest on earth, so they become more proud. Man: ""O Hud! Did you say that later we will die and turn
into dust, and then we will be resurrected?"" prophet Hud (pbuh) said, yes on the Day of
Judgment they will be asked about what they did. Man: ( with laugh) ""How strange his claims
are!"" Animal: So, they were arrogant, because Allah
(T) made them strong and rich? Animal_2: But they should be more grateful
to Allah (T)’s blessing! Animal_3: That’s why, generally poor people
are more religious then rich people. Yusuf: People were very ungrateful. People of Hud (pbuh),
They did not believe him about the day of judgment. They listened but disbelieved him. The chiefs of Hud's people asked: ""Is it not
strange that Allah choose one of us to reveal His message to?"" Prophet Hud (pbuh) replied, why was it strange? Allah (T) sent me to warn you. The history of Prophet Noah's ark and the
flood happened not too long ago. Did you forget what happened? All the disbelievers were destroyed, no matter
how strong they were. Chiefs: ""Who is going to destroy us Hud?"" Prophet Hud (pbuh) replied if they don't follow
him, Allah (T) will destroy them all. Chiefs: ""We will be saved by our gods."" Hud clarified to them that the gods that they
worshipped would be the reason for their destruction. The conflict between Hud and his people continued. The years passed, and they became more proud,
more arrogant, and more aggressive with their prophet Hud (pbuh). They started to accuse Hud (PBUH) of being
a crazy. One day they told him:
Man: ""We now understand the secret of your madness, you insulted our gods and they harmed
you; that is why you have become insane."" Prophet Hud (pbuh) warned them about Allah
(T) punishment. It is one of the laws of life. Allah punishes the disbelievers, no matter
how rich or strong they are. As a punishment, a drought spread throughout
the land, where there was no rain for the land. The heat of sun increased , and it felt like
the people's heads were on fire. Hud's people asked him: ""What is that drought
Hud?"" Hud answered: ""Allah is angry with you. If you believe in Him, He will accept you
and the rain will fall and you will become stronger than you are."" Animal: Wow the drought must’ve been really
bad. How come they still didn’t say sorry to
Allah (T)? Animal_2: Didn’t they know the punishment
were coming?! Yusuf: Yes, they knew the punishment was coming. Still they did not accept Prophet Hud (pbuh). They laughed at him. The drought increased, the trees turned yellow,
and plants died. A day came when they found the sky full of
clouds. Hud's people were glad to see the cloud. Men: ""This cloud will give us rain!"" The weather changed suddenly from burning
dry and hot to wind that shook everything; trees, plants, tents, men and women. The wind increased day after day and night
after night. Hud's people started to flee. They ran to their tents to hide but the wind
became stronger, ripping their tents. They hid under covers but the wind became
stronger tore away the covers. It cut the cloth and skin. The strong wind cracked the human body and
destroyed it. All the disbelievers were killed and their
body was torn away by the strong wind. The storm lasted for 8 days and 7 nights. Animal: So, it was just a storm? Yusuf: No, it was a very heavy send storm. That violent storm did not stop until the
entire region was turned into ruins and its wicked people destroyed, swallowed by the
sands of the desert. Only Hud and his followers remained unharmed. They migrated to Hadhramaut place in Yamen
and lived there in peace, worshipping their true Lord Allah(T)."
"Prophet Dawud (David) Around 350 to 450 years after Musa (pbuh)
died, the  children of Israel wanted a strong king. This  was during the 
time of Prophet Shammil or English known as Prophet Samuel (pbuh). So Allah (swt) chose a strong king for them. The king’s name was Talut or in English,
Saul. But the Bani Israel refused to accept Talut
as their king because he was not rich. Prophet Shammil or Samuel (pbuh) informed
them, Talut was selected by Allah (swt) because he was strong physically and mentally. And Allah (swt) gave him special knowledge
to protect Bani Israel as a king. As a sign from Allah (swt) Bani Israel got
back their blessing box by the Angels. During that time prophet Dawud, or in English
known as David (pbuh), was a young teenager. King Talut organized a strong army with strong
faith and wisdom. Those who were building a new home, who were
newly married and or those who was busy in their business were not allowed to join the
army. After establishing a well-trained army, they
started their journey to reach the battle field. On the way king Talut decided to test his
army. As Allah (swt) plan, he took the long way
to reach the battle field. On the way they became very thirsty. King Talut knew that there was a river headed
their way. He warned his solders that, Allah (swt) was
testing them with that river water. They should not drink any water from that
river, and if they must they could drink one sip of water and not more than that. But most of the solders did not listen to
their Talut's order. They drank lots of water from that river. So Talut did not take the bad soldiers who
did not follow his order. Animal: Wow, so how many soldiers were there
with him? Yusuf: Some historians say at first there
were almost 80 thousand soldiers. Out of that number, 76 thousand drank the
water from the river. And after that, King Talut had only 4 thousands
soldiers with him. King Talut's army became extremely small. So some of the soldiers became scared to fight
with the big and strong Palestinian army. At that time, the leader of the army was Jalut
or in English known as Goliath. He was a very big and strong and also very
bad. Some of the children of Israel had very strong
faith in Allah (swt). King Talut believed in quality but not numbers. He tried to convince the others to fight with
the big Palestinians and their army in the name of Allah (swt). If they had faith in Allah (swt), with even
a small group of army, they could win the battle. Finally, only a few soldiers decided to fight
with the very big group of Jalut's Army. Some historians say King Talut had only 314
solders but Allah (swt) knows the best. The two groups were ready to fight. Jalut or Goliath challenged any soldier from
King Talut’s army to fight with him. Animal: Goliath is really bad. Why did he want to fight one by one? Yusuf: It was tradition at that time in the
battle field. Jalut wanted to show off his strength and
because of that every one became scared to fight with Jalut. No one agreed to fight with him. Finally, a very young man stepped forward
to fight with Jalut.*** Everyone was surprised. That young man was Dawud or David (pbuh). He was from the city of Bethlehem. Some of his brothers also joined Talut's army. Dawud (pbuh) was very young at that time. He was not ready to be a soldier. He was just his brother’s helper. King Talut was not sure Dawud (pbuh) could
win. Talut wanted a more stronger soldier to fight
with Jalut. Dawud (pbuh) told King Talut to have faith
on him. He told him that once he killed a strong lion
just to protect the farm animals. Dawud (pbuh) even killed a bear as well. He wasn't afraid of anyone because he knew
that Allah (swt) would protect him from that evil Jalut. King Talut became very happy to hear Dawud
(pbuh) and gave an armor, which is a suit for protection and a sword. But Dawud did not take that. He took some rocks in his small leather bag
and a slingshot to throw those rocks. When Jalut saw Dawud (pbuh) he laughed loudly
and said, ""I will cut off your head with my sword!"" Dawud (pbuh) warned Jalut that he had power
from Allah (swt), who is the God of the children of Israel. Then in the name of Allah (swt) he slung the
rocks using the slingshot. The stone hit Jalut's head with great force. Jalut fell on the ground and died instantly. Jalut's army became scared. King Talut ordered his soldiers to attack
the enemies. Children of Israel got the courage and started
to destroy Jalut’s soldiers. It was great victory for Bani Israel. They retook their glory and honor that had
been lost for a long time. Dawud (pbuh) became a hero right away and
got married to King Talut's daughter and became the king's chief advisor. He was very good with people. So Allah (swt) chose him as a prophet for
Bani Israel and gave him the holy book Zabur. The English name is Psalms. Allah (swt) gave him a special power during
his prophet hood. He had the most beautiful voice in whole world.When
he read something from his book Zabur to pray to Allah (swt), the plants, birds, beasts
and even mountains joined with him. In a miracle from Allah (swt) he could understand
the languages of birds and animals. After a few years when king Talut died Allah
(swt) chose prophet Dawud (pbuh) as Bani Israel's king. Allah (swt) made him very wise and a strong
king. Animal: So he was the second king for Bani
Israel, right? Yusuf: Yes, Talut was first king and Prophet
Dawud was Second king. Animal: So, how long was Dawud (as) the king
for Bani Israel? Yusuf: Some historians say he ruled the Bani
Israel as a king for forty years. He had a very big and strong army. In his time, he controlled all of Palestine
and its surrounding areas. Animal: Oh really. Did you know Prophet Dawud (pbuh) used to
pray to Allah (swt) in a special way? He used to sleep the first half of the night,
then wake up and pray for one third of the night. Then he would again sleep for the rest of
the night, which was one sixth of it. He used to fast during the day time for Allah
(swt) every other day. Allah (swt) gave him special knowledge to
be a very good judge. Once he was praying in his prayer room, were
there was no one allowed to be there at that time. So in order to test him, Allah (swt) sent
two angels in his room. Prophet Dawud (pbuh) became scared to see
two people in his prayer room. One of them told him not to be afraid, they
came to get fair judgment for their problem. The first man said:
""This is my brother, who has ninety nine sheep, and I have only one sheep. Now he wants my sheep for himself."" Without hearing from the other person, Dawud
(pbuh) started to give his opinion. Suddenly the two people disappeared. Dawud (pbuh) realized that the two people
were angels and Allah (swt) sent them to teach him a lesson. Animal 1: (gasp), Allah (swt) send angels
to teach him a lesson? Animal 2: What kind of lesson did Allah (swt)
teach him at that moment? Yusuf: That he should not have give his judgment
without hearing both sides of the parties. He realized his mistake and he became sorry
to Allah (swt) and prostrated to him. Dawud (pbuh) was very good to his people. During the night time he used to visit the
town in disguise so no one could recognized him. He asked the people about the king. Everybody loved him and always said good things
about king Dawud (pbuh). One night an angel came to Dawud (pbuh) in
a human form.The angel told him, that king Dawud should not take money from the treasury
of the kingdom for his living expenses. Dawud (pbuh) requested Allah (swt) to give
him special ability so he could earn money and use that money for his living expenses. From that day he made weapons and sold it
to the market and used that money for his expenses. One day Dawud (pbuh) was working with iron
and suddenly he found his hand was making the iron soft. He could bend the iron easily to make the
iron any shape. Animal: Wow, that is amazing. How did the iron become soft for him? Yusuf: It was a special miracle from Allah
(swt) to Dawud (pbuh). Iron became like clay for him. Allah (swt) taught him how to make a shield
in a new way. It was a new invention by Dawud (pbuh). During his time, his soldiers had to join
in many wars. But his soldier's armor was made by iron metals. The dress was just in one piece. So it was not flexible to move and it was
very heavy for them. To make good armors, Allah (swt) gave him
knowledge to make little rings and put those rings together. Finally, the armor became very flexible and
it was very light. That was also prophet Dawud (pbuh)'s invention. Prophet Dawud (pbuh) was very protective for
his family. When he left the palace he locked all the
gates, so no one was allowed to come in. One day he went out and locked the doors as
usual. Suddenly his wife saw a man in the middle
of the house. She asked,
""How did you enter the house, when all the doors are locked? My husband Dawud would be very angry to see
you"" When Dawud (pbuh) came back, he saw the man
and asked him, who he was. The man replied, he was not afraid of any
king and no one could run away from him. The king Dawud (pbuh) realized, that was the
angel of death. Prophet Dawud (pbuh) was scared and he welcomed
the angel to take his soul from his body. In his funeral almost four thousand priest
and thousands and thousands people came to pray for him. It was a very hot and sunny day. Thousands and thousands of birds came to create
a shadow for the funeral. Some historians say, the great prophet and
the king Dawud (pbuh) died at the age of 70 years old. He was buried in the Jerusalem but we don't
know exactly where his grave is. This is the end of our beloved prophet Dawud
(pbuh)."
"Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) Part 1: Family Tree
Prophet Muhammed (saw)'s family tree started from prophet Ibrahim through Ismail (pbut). The prophet was born in the most respected
tribe in Arabia, the Quraysh.His family name is Hashim after his great grandfather. Hashim was very respected and generous. He used to take care of the people whoever
came to Makkah for Hajj and distribute food to them. He was a business man. For his business, during the winter he used
to travel to Yemen and during the summer he used to go Syria. He had very good connection with these two
countries. One summer at Madinah he married Salma in
his business trip and Salma got pregnant. After a few days Hashim died in Gaza, Palestine. Salma's baby boy was Shayba. Hashim's family did not know about Salma. After eight years Hashim’s younger brother
Muttalib knew about his brother's wife and son. So Muttalib brought them to Makkah. People called Shayba Muttalib’s slave, or
known as Abdul Muttalib. He was very smart, handsome and generous like
his father Hashim. Later Abdul Muttalib or Shayba became the
leader of Quraysh. Do you remember the miracle water of the Zamzam
well, which was discovered during the time of baby Ismail and his mother Hajar (pbut)? Animal: Yes. From that time, the people of the Jurham tribe
started to live in that area. After many, many years the people started
to worship idols as their god. So, as a punishment Allah (swt) decided to
dry the miracle water of the Zamzam well. Day by day it was covered with stone and sand. After some time everyone forgot about the
Zamzam well. It was lost for many years. One day Allah (swt) showed the location of
Zamzam well to Abdul Muttalib in his dream. He started to dig that place with one of his
son. The miracle water of the Zamzam well was found. At that time Abdul Muttalib promised to Allah
(swt) if he had ten sons, he would sacrifice one of his son to Allah (swt).Finaly Allah
(swt) gave him ten sons. One day Abdul Muttalib remembered his promise
to sacrifice one of his sons. But he don’t know which son he would choose. So he drew a lottery. His youngest son Abdullah, the prophet's father
was selected. Everyone loved Abdullah very much. So they offered one hundred camels to be sacrificed
instead of Abdullah. Then Abdul Muttalib drew lottery 3 times between
Abdullah and the one hundred camels. Every time Allah (swt) selected the one hundred
camels and saved our Prophet Mohammed (saw)’s father Abdullah .Later on Abdullah got married
to Amina, one the most honorable women in Quraysh. Her father's name was Wahb. Amina became pregnant after a few days. During that time, Abdul Muttalib sent his
son Abdullah to Syria for a business trip. However about two months before Mohammed (pbuh)
would be born, his father Abdullah died at Madinah, on his return journey. At that time he was only 25 years old. Animal: So, didn’t Abdullah see his son
Mohammed (pbuh) at all? Yusuf: No, Abdullah could not see his son
Mohammed (pbuh). But he knew his wife Amena was pregnant. Let’s come to story. During that time, Makkah was very famous for
house of God and it became a very big business center. Governor of Yemen, Abraha became very greedy
to take control of Makkah. At one excuse, he was ready to attacked Makkah
with a very big army. With him, he had sixty thousand solders and
and around 13 big elephants. Abraha used the biggest elephant for himself. The people of Makkah became scared. Abdul Muttalib had a very strong faith in
Allah (swt). He knew the house of Allah would be saved
in a miracle way because they did not had enough strength to fight Abraha’s Army. He told everyone to take all of their family
members and hide at the mountain tops. At that time prophet’s mother Amena was
seven months pregnant. Then the miracle started to happen. When Abraha’s army was close to Makkah,
all the elephant just sat right there. Nothing could move them. Suddenly, all the elephant started to run
in the other direction. Meanwhile, Allah (swt) sent lots of small
birds with three stones. One was in their beak and the other two were
in their claws. The birds dropped their stones on Abraha’s
men. The stones cut their body parts right away
and killed them instantly. Their body became like mashed corn. It was a horrible moment for Abraha’s Army. Every one of them died by Allah (swt) punishment. Animal: Why did Allah (swt) saved the Kabah
with that big miracle? At that time, Rome and Persian empires were
very powerful. That miracle was the big alarm to the whole
world. To warn them not to attack Makkah. It was a big welcome sign for prophet Muhammed
(saw) coming to protect Allah (swt)’s house and law. Around fifty days letter our beloved prophet
Muhammed (saw) was born on the twentieth or twenty-second of April, in the year of 571. It was a Monday morning. The Arabic date was 9th of Rabi Al- Awwal. Animal: But I thougt out Prophet Muhammed
(s) was born at 12 Rabi Al Awwal! Yusuf: Yes, some scholars also think, it was
12 Rabi al Awwal in the year of 570. But most researchers consider 9th Rabi Al
Awwal and the year of 571 to be most accurate. But let me clear up a thing, there are two
information. Rabi Al Awwal is Arbic month from Arabic calender
and year 571 is from the Christian calendar. so Allah (swt) knows best about the correct
birth date  of Muhammad (s)."
"After Solaiman (pbuh) death, 300 years passed. The people of Israel's situation became worse. They were forgetting about Allah (swt) and
started to worship the idol Baal as their god again! By this time they even killed many prophets. So Allah (swt) became very angry at the Bani
Israel. He decided to destroy the people and their
cities. But as the last warning Allah (swt) send prophet
Aramaya, or in English, Jeremiah (pbuh) to guide the Bani Israel. Animal: Why do Bani Israel always go back
to worshipping Baal as their god? Is there a history behind the idol Baal? Yusuf: After Prophet Musa (pbuh) death, Bani
Israel finally made it to Palestine. And from the beginning they loved Idol worshiping. Their male Idol's name was Ayl, which they
considered to be the father of the idols and his face looks like a cow. That Idol had a wife and her name was Asherah,
which they considered as the mother of Idols. Those idols couple had more than 70 children
and grand children. Among them, one of the idol's name was Baal. He was considered to be the god of rain and
growth and the lord of the earth and heavens. So the Idol Baal was considered to be the
most powerful god. He had two Idol wives. People kept one of the wife on the north side
of the country and her name was Anathoth. The other wife, people kept on the south side
of the country of the Palestine and her name was Ashtaroth. These two wife was consider the goddesses
of love and child birth. For some reason the people of Bani Israel
believed in this kind of crazy made up stories. Animal: Wow, that's really weired. How did they even believe on that? Yusuf: That's why, Allah (swt) told Jeremaya
that he would destroy the Bani Israel, prophet Jeremaih started to cry and requested to forgive
Bani Israel. Allah (swt) told him to go to the king and
the people of Israel and guide them to become good and accept Allah (swt) as their God and
they should follow Allah (swt)’s laws. Prophet Jeremiah also tried to convince the
people that it was their last chance otherwise they would be destroyed. But the people of Israel were very bad. They rejected his advice. They even told him that he was a liar. Bunny: But they were shown many miracles time
and time again! How can they say that he was a liar!? For some reason Bani Israel was always arrogant
no matter how many miracles they were shown. They could not believe that Allah (swt) would
destroy the Solomon Temple and Dome of the Rock. As you know in present time, these two things
are in Baitul Muqaddas or Masjid Al-Aqsa. The king was so arrogant that he ordered to
arrest the prophet and send him to the prison. And that was their final mistake. Allah (swt) sent their enemy which was the
king of Babylon, Nabuchadnezzar, to attack Israel. His big army surrounded the city. The Israel army surrendered and opened the
city gate. Thousands to Babylon’s army got into the
city and they were very cruel. They killed one third of the population of
Israel. It was a horrible moment for Bani Israel. The land was covered by people with blood. Dead bodied were all over the place. The Babylonians only let the disable and old
people to go but unfortunately they arrested the rest as their slaves. They destroyed all of the Bani Israel’s
houses. They even destroyed all the beautiful castles
and temples. Babylon’s army burned all of their holy
books including the Torah. They even were very rude with the children
and the women. It was the most terrible day for Bani Israel. Animal: Why did Allah (swt) gave them such
a big punishment? Yusuf: The children of Prophet Israel was
a very respected nation to Allah (swt). They had lots of powerful prophets to guide
and protect them. Allah (swt) gave them many opportunities to
be thankful to Allah (swt) and become good people. But unfortunately they always broke Allah
(swt)’s law. They even killed many prophets and continued
their Idol worship. That’s why Allah (swt) became very angry
and destroyed the whole nation. One day the king of Babylon heard that one
of the Bani Israel’s prophet knew about this disaster at advance, and that prophet's
name was Jeremiah. The king order to bring him from the prison. After talking to prophet Jememiah, the king
realized that, he was really the prophet of Allah (swt). The king let the prophet go as a free man. After destroying the whole city the king of
Babylon went back to his kingdom with valuable treasures, as well as men, women and children
with him. The historians say he took about seventy thousand
men and women with him as slaves. New beginning started for Bani Israel from
that moment. Prophet Jeremiah (pbuh) told the people, whoever
was in the city of Israel, to say sorry to Allah (swt) and ask forgiveness from Allah
(swt). He also told them that, Allah (swt) wanted
them to stay united and rebuild the town. But most of them did not want to stay in that
destroyed country. They again refused to follow the prophet’s
order. And so they were spread all over the world. Some of them moved to Hijar, Taif and Medina. Others moved to Egypt and some other countries. But prophet Jaramiah tried his best to rebuild
the Israel. Some historians say, later he moved to Egypt
and he died over there. But Allah (swt) knows 
the best."
"The First Muslims
After the second revelation, which was a portion of surah Mudassir, Muhammad (s) secretly started
to invite his closed family members friends to accept him as prophet and follow Allah
(swt) laws. According to Ibn Kathir, the top 4 people
who accepted Islam are: Khadija (pbuh) was the first Woman, Zayd (pbuh)
was the first free slave, Ali (pbuh) was the first child, and Abu Bakr (pbuh) was the first
free man who all became Muslims. Animal: So who was the second person who accepted
Islam after Khadija (pbuh)? Yusuf: There were different opinions about
that. Some scholars believe Muhammad (s)'s closed
friend Abu Bakr was the second person, who became a Muslim. Other scholars believe, Abu Bakr was not in
town at that time, and that he went to Yemen for his business trip. So in that viewpoint, Ali (pbuh), who was
only a 10 year old boy at that time, was the second person who accepted Islam. On the other hand there is another opinion
that all these 4 great people accepted Islam on the same day as when Allah (swt) sent the
second revelation. But Allah (swt) knows the best. For us, the main point is that they all were
the great Muslims who helped Muhammad (s) spread Islam with their life from the very
beginning. After a few days, Allah (swt) sent the first
complete Surah, which was surah al Fatiha. One day Angel Jibrael (pbuh) came and showed
the prophet how to wash the important parts of the body which were the steps to make Wudu. He was taught that wudu was needed in order
to prepare for the prayer. At that time, when the angel was teaching
the prophet how to pray, those who accepted Islam used to pray differently. They used to pray in secret, and made sure
that it was in a quiet place. During the first three years, Muhammad (s)
secretly spread Islam with Allah (swt)'s guide. During this time his goal was to find some
good people to make them a strong believer of Allah (swt) and make them a very good Muslim. He tried to tell them not to do Idol worshiping,
and explained to them that those idols were not their god. Those were just a piece of stone or mud. The true God is, the God of Adam, Ibrahim,
Moses and Jesus (pbut) all. Spreading Islam in secret continued to happen
for almost three years. However, even though he didn’t spread Islam
openly at that point, people knew about his work; and since he never did it in publicly,
the bad people also could not say anything about his work. Animal: So how many people accepted Muhammad
(s) as a prophet? Yusuf: According to some scholars, by that
time there were only around 130 people or less who accepted Muhammad (s) as their Prophet. When Muhammad (s) got some strong supporters,
Allah (swt) ordered him to tell the people openly to everyone so they would stop their
Idol worshipping and accept Allah (swt) as their God. After receiving the order from Allah (swt),
during his first gathering, about 45 people came and Muhammad (s) talked about Allah (swt)'s
law and order. But from the beginning, the prophet had a
very bad uncle named Abu Lahab. When the prophet went out to preach in public,
Abu Lahab started to shout and threaten Muhammad (s), and told him not to talk about the one
and only God Allah (swt). So in that very first meeting, because of
Abu Lahab, Muhammad (s) could not say anything to the people. So in another day he had a small gathering
with the people that he personally selected, so that meant that on that day, Abu Lahab
wasn't there to disturb the prophet while he was preaching. In that meeting, Muhammad (s) openly said
that, he was a prophet from Allah (swt). He also told the people to do good actions
because this life is very short and there is a life after our death where all of our
good and bad deeds will matter. And at that time, Allah (swt) will judge us
to see who was good, and who believed in him as the one and only God. If we are good, Allah (swt) will be happy
with us and grant us heaven. Otherwise we will have to stay with the evil,
which is in a very bad place. After hearing that, his very good uncle, Abu
Talib, who loved him very much and took care of him starting from his childhood, told Muhammad
(s) that, he would not be a Muslim. Animal: (gasp). So, he did not help Muhammad (s) anymore? Well, even though he was not a Muslim, he
promised to protect Muhammad (s) from the bad people throughout his entire life. That was a very good news for Muhammad (s)
but bad for Abu Lahab who did not like that and became very mad. One early morning, when everyone was sound
asleep, Muhammad (s) woke up and climbed Mount Safa. Then all the sudden in the early quiet morning,
Muhammad (s) started to scream, Ya sabahah, Ya sabahah. Meaning O, morning Disaster. People from every house starting to come out
to hear prophet Muhammad (s) because they thought that there was an enemy that was coming
to attack them. Then the prophet asked, ""If I tell you that
behind the hill there was an enemy ready to attack you, would you believe me?"" Everyone said, yes, because he never said
a lie. Then Muhammad (s) said, if you don't believe
in Allah (swt), a big punishment will come to you. Then his uncle Abu Lahab became very mad and
said,"" you called us only for that? You should die!!""This was the first open invitation
for everyone, and right then Abu Lahab threw a stone at the prophet Muhammad (s), and the
people were started to leave. From that day, he started to tell people about
Allah (swt)'s laws and orders in every corner of the town, and he openly started to pray
at the Kabah. Many people started to feel like Islam was
a logical and true religion so they accepted Allah (swt) as their only true God and Muhammad
(s) as a true prophet. Soon at least one member of each family had
become a Muslim. However, as a result those who became Muslims,
their family members did not like that. So they were very rude to them and sometimes
they even punished them  for becoming a Muslim."
"Alhamdulillah. We are about to learn one of the greatest
prophets which was Prophet Isa (pbuh). He was the last prophet from Bani Israel. Since Bani Israel kept on making the same
terrible crimes that were forbidden by Allah, he stopped sending prophets from them after
prophet Isa (pbuh). Prophet Isa (pbuh)'s story started from his
grandparents Imran (pbuh). He was a very good religious leader for the
children of Israel, but he was not a prophet. His wife and prophet Zakaria's wife were two
sisters. Imran and his wife (pbut) did not have any
child for many years but they did not lose her faith. With Allah (swt)'s blessing during their old
age Imran's wife became pregnant. She was so happy that she promised to give
her child for Allah (swt)'s work. During her pregnancy her husband Imran (pbuh)
died. After a few days she gave birth, and she was
surprised because her child was a girl. At that time girls were not useful for any
religious work. So she prayed to Allah (swt) to save her and
her child from Satan and named the baby Mariyam, or in English, Mary (pbuh). Then, Mariyam’s mother gave Mariyam (pbuh)
to the temple of Baitul Maqdis since she promised to Allah (swt) to give up her child for Allah
(swt)'s work. Animal: So, at that time Mariyam (as) was
just a little baby? Yusuf: We don't know how old she was at that
time. But she was brought to the temple by her mother
for prayer and work and get Allah (swt)'s blessing. So it could've been when she was old enough
to work in the temple but Allah (swt) knows the best, but you can get more information
in Surah Imran. At that time women were not allowed at the
temple to stay. So she needed a guardian from the temple. Many priests wanted to take care of Mariyam
(pbuh) because everyone used to respect her father Imran (pbuh) very much. But her uncle prophet Zakaria (pbuh) wanted
to take care Mariyam (pbuh) the most, since he was her uncle and at that time he did not
have any child. So as their tradition, they draw a lottery
by throwing their pen into the river. Everyone's pen sank into the river but prophet
Zakaria's pen was still floating in the water. You can find this story in Surah Imran verse
44. By winning the lottery, Allah (swt) chose
prophet Zakaria (pbuh) to take care of young Mariyam (pbuh). For her protection, Zakaria (pbuh) built a
separate room inside the temple. As she grew up, she became a very religious
woman. Our prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said Mariyam (pbuh)
was one of the top 4 great women of all time. Animal: Who are the other 3 women? Yusuf: One of them is Asia (pbuh), who was
the wife of the Pharaoh and the other two were Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)'s wives, Khadijah
and Ayesha (pbut). When Mariyam (pbuh) became a teenager she
needed a private quiet area for her prayer. So she started to live on the east side of
the Temple. But some scholars say that she started living
on the east side of the town, which was a very quiet place. But Allah (swt) knows the best. Prophet Zakaria (pbuh) used to visit her daily
and taught her about Allah (swt)'s laws. One day he was surprised to see some fresh
fruits, which were out of season in her room. He asked her how the fruits got there. She told him that sometimes Allah (swt) would
send fruits to her. He was so surprised to hear that. After this event the very old prophet Zakaria
prayed for a good son to guide Bani Israel. Then as a miracle, a few days later his very
old wife got pregnant. Around six-months after that, Allah (swt)
decided to send a surprising news to Mariyam (pbuh) by an angel. She was very scared to see the angel and she
requested him not to harm her. The Angel told her not to worry and he had
very good news from Allah (swt). With Allah (swt)'s plan she would give birth
to a very good son. His name would be Isa, or in English known
as Jesus, and he would be a prophet of Bani Israel. She was surprised and asked, how was it possible? She was not married and she was not a bad
woman either! And the Angel told her, it is very easy for
Allah (swt) to give her a baby without a father. Animal: Why did Allah (swt) create Prophet
Isa (pbuh) without a father? Yusuf: To show Bani Israel a miracle and to
show them that he was a true prophet from Allah (swt) and so that they would follow
his advice, because at that time Bani Israel were not following Allah (swt)'s laws. So as a miracle Mariyam (pbuh) became pregnant. Day by day, a few people started to guess
that she was pregnant. At that time to avoid the public shame of
carrying a child without a husband, one day she left the house and started to walk to
a place, where there wasn’t any people that could see her condition. Some historians say it was close to Bethlehem. But Allah (swt) knows the best. In Surah Mu’minun verse 50 we know that,
Allah (swt) guided her to a safe place on the top of a hill. For her need, Allah (swt) supplied spring
water and food for her. One day her pain started when she was starting
to give birth to the baby. She didn't know what to do and sat under a
palm tree. Within a short time, she gave birth to a very
beautiful son. According to some historians the birthday
of Jesus (pbuh) was Saturday April 17th, between 4 to 6 BC. But Allah (swt) knows the best. After seeing her son, she started to cry and
thought about how she would explain to everyone that her baby did not has a father. No one would believe her. Right after giving birth, she was very hungry
and thirsty. To solve her problems, Allah (swt) sent Angel
Jibrael (pbuh). From the distance down the hill the Angel
told her not to worry because Allah (swt) would solve all of her problems. Mariyam (pbuh) became very happy to hear that. The Angel told her to touch or shake the palm
tree and as a Miracle, fresh ripe dates dropped down for her to eat. Animal: After she gave birth, why did Allah
(swt) give her fresh dates to eat? Yusuf: For a new mother, dates are the best
food for their health and energy. So after that, with the angel's advice, Mariyam
(pbuh), returned to her people with her baby. People knew she was a very religious person
but now they were surprised. They thought that she had become a very bad
woman. They were blaming her for that baby, and asked
her why she did that. Mariyam (pbuh) did not say anything and pointed
at the baby for their answers. People became angry. How could the little baby talk to them. Suddenly, in a miracle, baby Jesus (pbuh)
started to talk and said, that he was Allah (swt)’s servant and prophet. Allah (swt) sent him to establish prayer and
collect Zakat for the poor people, as well as taking care of his mother. You can find more details of this story in
Surah Mariyam, verse two. When the people heard that the little baby
was talking, they realized that he was a special baby and it was a miracle from Allah (swt). Some of them believed in him and his mother,
Mariyam (pbuh). But unfortunately some of them didn’t like
that. Some historians say, that somehow the King
Herod and some of his people thought, Jesus (pbuh) would be bad for them. So they planned to kill baby Jesus (pbuh). With Allah (swt)'s plan Mariyam took her baby
and moved to another place. Animal: Where did prophet Isa and Mariyam
(as) move to? Yusuf: From the Quran and Hadith we don't
know where they moved, but some historians say, at first they moved to Egypt. After a year when King Herod died, they moved
to Nazareth, a small town in northern Palestine. Over there he spent his childhood. Animal: I am just curious, after Jesus was
born, did Mariyam (pbuh) get married or have any other children? Yusuf: That is a very tough Question. From the Quran, Hadith or any Islamic historians
we didn't find proof that she ever got married or have any other children beside Isa (pbuh). But Allah (swt) knows the best. From the Quran or Hadith, we don't find any
detail information about prophet Isa (pbuh)'s childhood, however the only story we found
was from Ibn Kasir. Usually Bani Israel celebrated a special event
called 'Passover', which was a big holiday. For an example like our Eid. So lots of people used to come to the Baitul
Maqdis from different places. When Isa (as) was twelve years old he came
to Baitul Maqdis with his mother on that special day. He went into the temple to hear speeches from
the priests. In that huge crowd, everyone over there was
an adult. One time he asked questions to the priests,
and those were so hard that the priests didn't even know the answer. As Jesus started to grow up, he noticed that
some people are doing extreme terrible things in the name of religion. Yusuf: You remember about the law of Sabbath
right? Animal: Yes, during the time of Prophet Musa,
Allah (swt) made it a law that from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset they should pray
during that time and they should not waste their time by doing any work. Yusuf: MashaAllah, you remembered that. But day by day some bad priests made their
Sabbath law harder and harder, and it made it very difficult for the people. Sometimes during Sabbath, the bad priests
did not even allow to call the doctors for very sick people. That's why many times people cheated and broke
Allah (swt)'s laws. So, to make the people's life easy, Allah
(swt) decided to remove some of the hard rules. Prophet Zakariya and his son Prophet Yahiya
(pbut) were trying very hard to guide the Bani Israel to follow Allah (swt)'s law but
it did not work. One time the bad king and some of the Bani
Israel decided to kill those two great prophets. Prophet Zakaria and his son prophet Yahiya
(pbut) were killed on the same day, but unfortunately none of the Bani Israel tried to save them
and they even did not say anything to stand up against those bad people. So Allah (swt) became very angry with Bani
Israel's action. But the Merciful Allah (swt) gave one last
chance to the Bani Israel with the miracle born Jesus (pbuh). On the same day when prophet Zakaria and Yahiya
(pbut) were killed, Allah (swt) chose Jesus (pbuh) as a prophet to guide Bani Israel. Everyone knew that he truly was a prophet
because of his miracle birth, so no one questioned him becoming a prophet. &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;
Animal: Did Allah (swt) send prophet Isa (as) only to the Bani Israel? Yusuf: Yes, Prophet Jesus was sent only for
the Bani Israel and you will also find the answer in Surah Imran verse 48 to 50. Even in the Bible, the book of Matthew chapter
15, verse 24, also mentions that prophet Isa (pbuh) only came for Bani Israel. Allah (swt) taught him all the books which
were given to Musa and Dawud (pbuh). Jesus (pbuh) understood the depth meaning
of Allah (swt)'s laws. Allah (swt) also gave him a new book of laws. And that was called the Ingil, or in English
the Gospel of Jesus (pbuh). From his hometown, in one gathering he declared
his prophet hood to the people. But unfortunately his own relatives and people
of the town started to refuse him and his message. Day by day, it became very difficult for him
to make others follow Allah (swt)'s law. Only a few people accepted him as a prophet. In those difficult situations, one day he
asked some of the believers to be his helper and protect him from the enemies. Some of the believers agreed to be his helper. In Quran those helpers are called 'Hawary'. They were very respectful and very good followers,
like sahabas in Islam. Some scholars believe there were eleven to
seventeen great special followers that stood with Prophet Isa (as). They started to move from one place to another
to tell the people about Allah (swt)'s laws. During his work, he showed many miracles to
the people with Allah (swt)'s help. You will find some of the examples in Surah
Imran, verse 49. One day he was crossing a market place with
his followers and on the way he saw a blind man who was begging and said that he had been
blind his whole life. Prophet Jesus (pbuh) felt very bad for that
blind man. So he prayed to Allah (swt) to cure the blind
man's eyes. When he touch the blind man's eyes, as a miracle
in front of many people, the blind man was able to see the world for the first time! At that point many people instantly knew that
he truly was the prophet from Allah (swt).One day, in a small town he was giving a speech
to the people, and then a man came to him and explained his very deadly skin disease
and requested the prophet to cure his disease. Jesus (pbuh) prayed to Allah (swt) for that
person. And as a miracle Allah (swt) cured his disease
in front of many people. After see that miracle, many people started
to follow Allah (swt)’s laws. Animal: How long did Prophet Isa (as) invite
people to follow Allah (swt)'s law? Yusuf: Some historians say he was a prophet
for about three years. But some bible researchers also believe that
he invited the people to Allah (swt)'s law for only one year. One third of the bible talked only about his
last week of life on Earth. But if Jesus (pbuh) started his work after
Prophet Yahiya (pbuh)'s death, his prophet hood timing would be even shorter because
according to the historians, Prophet Yahiya (pbuh) died on June and Prophet Isa (pbuh)
left the earth the next April. If that was the case, his prophet hood time
would be around 10 months only. But Allah (swt) knows the best. It is not important how long he guided the
Bani Israel. The most important thing was all of his extraordinary
work he did by Allah (swt). For Bani Israel, he even showed the big miracle
by the help of Allah (swt). One time on his way, he saw a dead child. The child’s family was crying. People asked Jesus (pbuh) to help the dead
child. Prophet Jesus did not have the power to give
life to the dead. So he prayed to Allah (swt) to give life back
to that child. As a miracle the dead child got his life back. Everyone was so surprised. How was that even possible! Many Bani Israel realized that Isa (as) was
a real prophet and they accepted him as a messenger of Allah (swt). Some scholars say, Prophet Jesus (pbuh) all
together helped 4 people to get their life back with Allah (swt)'s help. Some of the bad Bani Israel could not believe
his miracle and they claimed that he could only give life back to those who died recently;
maybe they did not died and only fainted. To prove his ability they asked him to bring
life back to someone who died a very long time ago. People showed him a very old grave and when
prophet Isa (pbuh) prayed to Allah (swt), as a miracle that dead person got his life
back and came out from the grave. We found that story from Ibn Kasir but Allah
(swt) knows best. After seeing extraordinary miracles from Isa
(pbuh), unfortunately, some of the Bani Israel even started to believe that he might be a
god. Nauzubillah. May Allah (swt) save us from that bad thinking. Animal: So, did prophet Isa (as) clear their
misunderstanding? Yusuf: Yes, in Surah Mayida, verse 72, Allah
(swt) told us, that Jesus (pbuh) clearly explained to the people, he was not a God. God is the one and only Allah (swt). Even in the Bible, John chapter 5 verse 30,
Jesus (pbuh) clearly told the people, that he cannot do anything by himself and the only
thing that he does is follow Allah (swt)'s order. In another section in the Bible, in the book
of John chapter 8 verse 28, Jesus (pbuh) said to his people, all the miracles done by him
were from Allah (swt). After seeing many miracles, even prophet Isa
(pbuh)'s close followers were also confused about him and Allah (swt)'s power. In Surah Mayida verse 112, we found some information
about that story. One time Isa (pbuh) and his close followers
came to a town and they did not have any food to eat so they were very hungry. People of that town also did not have enough
food. Then the followers asked prophet Isa (pbuh),
if he could pray to Allah (swt) to send food for them from the heaven. Since the people always challenged him, by
constantly demanding to see the miracles from Allah (swt), Prophet Jesus was very upset. He ordered them to be careful about challenging
Allah (swt), and they immediately understood that it was a mistake and became very sorry
for their behavior. Then prophet Isa (pbuh) requested Allah (swt)
to send some food for everybody and show the people a great miracle. So as a response, Allah (swt) replied that
he would send the food from the heaven, but after seeing the miracle, if anyone rejected
Allah (swt) and his orders, Allah would give them a very big punishment. Then Allah (swt) sent lots of food to everybody
and when the prophet's followers saw the food, they asked him where the food was coming from. Was it coming from heaven or some other place? The Prophet warned them not to ask too much
questions and to be grateful about Allah (swt)'s blessings. Some historians say, Allah (swt) sent fish
and bread for more than 5000 people, but Allah (swt) knows the best. Day by day his followers became bigger and
bigger. Even some of the rich people started to give
away their money to the poor people. The prophet could also tell the people what
they ate that day and what they kept in their house for tomorrow to eat. Now remember Sabbath happens every Friday
as soon as the sunsets, so one Friday night, Jesus (pbuh) saw that there were some children
and they were so hungry that they were crying! So he picked out some fruits for those hungry
children. Some of the people did not like his action
because it was breaking the Sabbath law. Another cold Friday night Isa (pbuh) saw some
old ladies who were freezing in the weather. So he made a fire for those old ladies. That was another Sabbath law broken by Prophet
Jesus (pbuh). The religious leaders also did not like his
actions. Prophet Isa (pbuh) continued his teachings
to the Bani Israel until spring time. Bani Israel had a very big special holy day
that they celebrated during the spring time, around the month of April. It was called 'Passover'. It was a celebration of gratefulness to Allah
(swt), for saving the Bani Israel from slavery in Egypt hundreds of years ago. Usually it was an eight day celebration where
there would be lots of people who used to come from different places to the Baitul Maqdis
in Jerusalem. Prophet Isa (pbuh) thought, that would be
the perfect time to go to the Baitul Maqdis and guide the people about Allah (swt)’s
laws. According to the historians, Prophet Isa (pbuh)
entered Jerusalem on Saturday, which was the first day of the 'Passover' holy day week. But Allah (swt) knows the best. By that time he already had many enemies from
Bani Israel, and unfortunately during that week, it was his final week of living on the
earth of his first life. Animal: Haa..really? He was very brave. Yusuf: Yes, he was. He always followed Allah (swt) order. In Surah Baqara verse 87 Allah (swt) tells
us, prophet Isa (pbuh) was always protected by Angel Jibrail or the holy book Ingil. He went to the temple area and looked around. He noticed that there were so many priests
and everyone there made money from the temple for their living. The rooms inside the temple were filled with
the priests and their people but only very few visitors were allowed to come in those
room, because it was very expensive for them. Every step in the temple visitor had to spend
money. Suppose a poor family wanted to sacrifice
a sheep for Allah (swt). So after they raised their sheep, when they
came to the temple with that sheep to sacrifice, the priests did not them allow to sacrifice
their own sheep because they had to buy a sheep from the temple people. Because of that only rich people were welcome
in the temple. The Priests and their people acted as if it
was a market place. And it was so bad that in the temple the priest
used to waste lots of food even though they knew that outside of the temple the poor people
were very hungry. Prophet Isa (pbuh) became very sad after seeing
that situation. He saw that the priests changed or misunderstood
most of the laws from their holy book for their own benefits. So Jesus tried to explain to the people in
order to save them from the mistakes that they were making. Allah (swt) sent new laws for them and corrected
some of their old laws. But unfortunately most of the priests did
not like Prophet Jesus (pbuh), because his teaching went against the benefits of the
bad priests. They started saying that Jesus was not a prophet. So he had to show many miracles to the people
to prove that he was a true prophet from Allah (swt) like Adam, Ibrahim, Musa and all of
the other prophets (pbut all). In Surah Baqara verse 49 Allah (swt) told
us, at that time Jesus (pbuh) showed a great miracle about Allah (swt)'s power. He took some mud and molded it into the shape
of a bird. After that in the name of Allah (swt), he
blew his breath in it. Suddenly Allah (swt) turned that clay into
a real bird and that bird started to fly. Everyone was surprised to see that. Many people realized that he truly was a prophet
from Allah (swt). But most of the priests and some of the bad
Bani Israel thought he came to destroy the laws of Moses and Dawud (pbut). But he told them that he did not come to destroy
the old laws. He came to complete the laws. Animal: Was he able to complete the laws? Yusuf: No, for some of the bad Bani Israel,
Prophet Jesus (pbuh) could not fulfill Allah (swt)'s laws. So finally he said to the people, he had many
things to say to them but they were not capable to accept Allah's law. So Allah (swt) would send a final messenger
to guide not only them but to guild the whole universe. And his name would be Ahmed. And that is one of the names of our last prophet
Muhammad (s). We can find this story in the Bible John chapter
16 verse 12, and the same information can also be found in the Quran Surah As-Saf, verse
6. Another story we found in the Bible was Mathew
chapter 22, verse 36-40. One day an educated Bani Israel came to Prophet
Jesus (pbuh) and asked him what the most important order from Allah (swt) was. Jesus (pbuh) replied, to obey the one and
only God Allah (swt) and to be good with the neighbors and love them from the heart. He had basically three fundamental missions
like other prophets. 1. To tell the people that there is no god except
Allah and he is the one and only God and strongly believe in him. 2. Follow him as a prophet and messenger who
was selected by Allah (swt). 3. Follow all of Allah (swt)'s laws. If Allah said Halal, enjoy them. But if Allah made something Haram for us,
never ever do or take them. It was the same mission for any other prophets
that Allah had sent from Adam (pbuh) to the last prophet, Muhammad (pbuh). Prophet Jesus (pbuh)’s mission was getting
better and better. Lots of poor people started to follow him. So for the temple, the bad priests’ businesses
became very bad and they could not make money even during the busiest week of the whole
year. Most of the Bani Israel priests did not like
that and became very angry. So they were planning on how to stop Isa(as). At first they started to say bad things about
Jesus (pbuh). The bad people were even saying that his birth
was not a miracle and his mother also a bad woman. That's why he didn’t has a father. In different places the priests and their
people tried to stop him. Sometimes they threatened him too. But prophet Isa (as) and his strong helpers
did not stop. When the priests saw it was impossible for
them to stop. They made a plan to kill Prophet Jesus (pbuh). One of the priests advised the others not
to kill Jesus (pbuh) like they did with Prophet Zakaria and his son Prophet Yahiya (pbut)
because people started to believe in Jesus (pbuh) and they might not like that. The people even could blame the priests for
their bad action. So the priests made a plan and went to the
Roman governor. He was given the responsibility to control
Palestine. The priests convinced the Roman Governor that,
if they cannot stop Prophet Jesus (pbuh), even the Romans would be affected because
they could not make money from Baitul Maqdis and they would lose their control over Palestine. So the Roman Government became angry at Jesus
(pbuh). Then the Roman Government and the top priests
decided to kill Jesus (pbuh) by Crucifixion. In that situation Prophet Jesus (pbuh) became
worried. He did not know what to do. In Surah Imran verse 55 Allah (swt) explained
that situation and told to prophet Isa (pbuh) not to worry and gave him five good news. Allah (swt) said,
1. The Bad Bani Israel could not kill him. 2. For his safety Allah (swt) will take him to
the second sky. 3. Allah removed all kind of misunderstanding
against him by Bani Israel 4. More people would be follow him and reject
the Bad Bani Israel's priests. 5. And Allah (swt) would solve all of their misunderstandings
in the Day of Judgment between Jesus and those who don't believe him as a prophet. As planned, during a Friday evening, some
priests and their people took some soldiers and went to a house where prophet Jesus was
teaching Allah (swt)'s laws to some of his followers. The house was locked from the inside. So they surrounded the house to arrest prophet
Isa (pbuh). The bad people were telling Jesus (pbuh) to
come outside, otherwise they would break the door and arrest him. It was starting to get dark in that room where
there were about 12 to 17 other people that were with Jesus (pbuh). But Allah (swt) knows the best. As Allah (swt)'s plan, Jesus (pbuh) asked
his followers, if there was anyone who would be willing to die for him and as a reward,
Allah (swt) would grant him paradise. A young man stepped forward and agreed to
save prophet Isa (pbuh). Isa (pbuh) asked two more times in order to
make sure that he found the right person and every time he asked, that young man came forward. Jesus (pbuh) became very happy with that young
man. With Allah (swt)'s miracle the young man was
transformed to looked like Jesus (pbuh). At that same time a hole opened in the roof
of the house and suddenly Jesus (pbuh) fell asleep and as a miracle he was taken by moving
up to the sky. In the Surah Nisa verse 157, Allah (swt) strongly
says, the bad Bani Israel could not kill or crucify Prophet Jesus (pbuh). After that miracle everyone came out from
the house. It was already night and Sabbath had started. When the bad people saw the great young man
that looked like Jesus (pbuh), they arrested him and took him to the place where they wanted
to kill him. Because it was Sabbath night, they were in
a hurry to do their work. So they could not realize that the man they
were going to kill was not the real Jesus (pbuh). Within a short time they crucified the great
follower of Isa (pbuh) and killed that innocent young man, which was a very tragic moment
for Bani Israel. However the Bani Israel was a fool since they
did not realize, that was the last prophet from them. Within a year Bani Israel killed the great
believers of Allah, which were Zakaria, Yahiya and the man that looked like Jesus (pbut). It was their last chance that they had in
which Allah (swt) was merciful towards them. Unfortunately, no one came forward to stop
that evil act. Allah (swt) did not like Bani Israel's behavior
and became very angry at Bani Israel. As you know the people of Bani Israel were
previously special and blessed by Allah (swt). In the Quran, Allah (swt) mentioned many prophets. You would be surprised, that more then 70%
of the prophets came from the root of Bani Israel. But for their biggest mistake, Allah (swt)
decided not to be special to Bani Israel anymore. In Surah Imran verse 55, Allah (swt) promised,
the group who believes in Jesus (pbuh)'s prophet hood would be always bigger than those who
don't believe in his prophet hood. Animal: So, does that mean the Christian group
will always be bigger than Muslims? Yusuf: No, Allah (swt)'s promise is, those
who believe in Jesus (pbuh) as a prophet, that group would be bigger. There were lots of Christian people who believed
Jesus was a prophet and all of his miracles were done by the supreme power by the one
and only God. And all Muslims as a whole also believe in
Jesus (pbuh)'s miracle and his prophet hood. If we add these people, these two groups make
a much bigger group than those who killed Prophet Jesus (pbuh). Bani Israel's family root came from the branch
of Prophet Ibrahim's younger son Ishaq (pbuh), but for their biggest mistake Allah (swt)
decided to send the last and final prophet to complete Allah (swt)'s laws from the root
of prophet Ibrahim's oldest son, prophet Ismail (pbuh), and that is where the root of Muhammad
(saw) comes from who is the final and last prophet. His name was even mentioned in all of the
other religious books. From the Quran and Hadith we can also confirm
that, Jesus (pbuh) will come back to Earth again and start to spread Allah (swt)'s final
law, the Quran to all the people and he will also believe in the last and final prophet
Muhammad (pbuh). According to great mathematician Isaac Newton,
the last day on earth of the great respected prophet Jesus (pbuh) was Friday April 7th
in the year of 30 AD. But Allah (swt) knows the best. After Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)’s story, InshaAllah
we will try to do another video about Prophet Jesus's return to the earth for the second
time. This is the end of our prophet story for today. This project was very difficult for us since
we wanted to make sure we had the most accurate information about each and every one of the
prophet stories. For more than six months our research team
worked very hard day and night to write the story of prophet Isa (pbuh). For this story we had to use many great Quran
Tafsirs of the world, many historians and also Palestine’s old history. As you know we always try to present very
complicated issue in an extremely easy way so that we can teach Islam to young children,
Muslim Adults, along with non Muslims as well. If there was any unintentional mistake, may
Allah (swt) forgive us and accept our effort. If you like our work, please help us to continue

"Muhammad (s) Became Prophet
From his childhood, Muhammad (s) was very intelligent and modest. His honesty, bravery, justice, patience, and
friendship attracted everyone. During his lifetime he never worshiped any
idols and he never drank any alcohol. He did not like noisy or crowded places. Whenever he stayed alone, he was in deep thinking
about Allah (swt)'s creation and he tried to know about the creator of everything. When Muhammad (s) 38 years old, he decided
to spend more time alone in Mount Noor, or another name was Mount Hira, which was two
miles away from Makkah. There was a cave in that mountain top, that
was around 4 meters in length and one and a half meter in width. He spent his whole Ramadan in that cave for
his deep thinking about who the real God was. After Ramadan ended, he visited the Kabah
first and he then went back home. During the next year, he also spent the month
of Ramadan in Cave Hira. Day by day he started to go more often to the cave of Hira. In the cave when his dry food was finished,
he would go to his wife Khadija (pbuh), and she would pack more dry food for him, then
Muhammad (s) would go back to the quiet place, which was cave Hira. 6 months before his prophet
hood, Allah (swt) started to show him several dreams, and later on those dreams would come
true! The fact that his dreams would all come true,
was one of the signs of his prophet hood. During that time he spent several day and
night in that cave, and this habit of his continued to happen until his 3rd year of
Ramadan. Animal: Why did he spend so much time alone
in that cave? Yusuf: It was Allah (swt)'s plan to prepare
him for his prophet hood. During the 3rd year of Ramadan in cave Hira,
he was around 40 years old. On the 21st of Ramadan just before sunrise,
that was the day when Allah (swt) selected him as the last and final prophet for all
of mankind. It was Monday, August 10 in the year of 610. He was in deep thinking in his worship. Suddenly Angel Jibrael, or in English, Gabriel
(pbuh) came in front of Muhammad (s) and said to him, ""Read"". Muhammad (s) became very scared and replied
that he cannot read. Angel Jibrael (pbuh) held and pressed him
very hard so that he could not breathe. After that he released him and the angel asked
him again to read. Again Muhammad (s) replied that he cannot
read. The angel held him and pressed him again very
hard and released him. Then he asked Muhammad (s) to read. Muhammad (s) again said he cannot read. For the third time the Angel held and pressed
him again very hard until he could not take his breathe any more. After releasing him, angel said, ""read in
the name of your lord and your creator, who created everything in the Universe"". When the angel said these words to the prophet
that was the moment when the Angel gave the prophet the first five sentence of Surah Alaq. And these were the first verses that had ever
been revealed to prophet Muhammad (saw) Animal: So why did the Angel hold and press
him very hard when asking him the question? Yusuf: That is what made him very unique and
special. His miracle was that he could easily memorize
anything that Angel Jibrael (pbuh) would tell him, word by word and letter by letter. In Surah Nahl, verse 102, it explains to us
that the Holy Spirit and angel Jibrael (pbuh) are the same. So after seeing the Holy Spirit, Muhammad
(s) became very scared and his heart was beating so fast and he was shaking so much. He immediately returned home and asked his
wife Khadija (pbuh) to hold and cover him tightly. When he calmed down, he told her everything
that happened to him. Khadija (pbuh) told him not to worry, she
told him, Allah (swt) would protect him because he was a very good person. Then Khadija (pbuh) decided to take him to
her very old cousin, Waraqa ibn Nawfal. He did not worship any idols and he was a
follower of prophet Jesus and his Holy Book, the Bible. After hearing Muhammad (s), Waraqa immediately
realized the final and last prophet which was mentioned in the Bible, in book Isaiah,
chapter 29, verse 12. (Isaiah, 29:12). He also said that, it was the same Angel that
Allah (swt) sent to Musa (pbuh) and he warned Muhammad (s) that his own people will start
to dislike him since he would be spreading the truth to the world; and because of that,
he would have to later on leave his city Mecca. Muhammad (s) was very surprised to hear that. Waraqa became sad that he could not help Muhammad
(s) in his hard time because he was very old and blind. Unfortunately, a few days after that day,
Warawa died. Many days passed, and the Angel Jibreel (pbuh)
did not return. Muhammad (s) became very worried and sad. But he still continued his deep thinking about
Allah (swt). One day after his prayer in the cave of Hira,
he was walking towards his home. Suddenly Angel Jibrael (pbuh) called Muhammad
(s) by his name and gave him a good news that he was the last prophet from Allah (swt). Muhammad (s) was surprised and saw the Angel
who was very, very big. The prophet was very scared to see him like
that and so he ran to his home. Khadija (pbuh) held and covered him tightly
with a blanket. After he cooled down, Allah (swt) told him
to remove the blanket and go to the people to tell about Allah (swt)'s orders, and this
was the first 5 sentences of Surah Mudassir. And it was after this point which was the
starting point of spreading Islam. Animal: How did Allah (swt) send the verse
of the Quran to prophet Muhammad (s)? Yusuf: Allah (s) gave the Surah or Revelation
to Muhammad (s) in 7 different ways. 1. Through a dream. 2. Angel Jibrael, or the Holy spirit (pbuh) who
would come to Muhammad (s)'s heart and give some sentences of the Quran.
3. Angel Jibrael coming to the prophet as a human
form. 4. Angel Jibrael coming to Muhammad (s) with
the bell or a ringing sound and this way was very difficult for prophet. 5. Sometimes Angel Jibrael came in his real form. 6. When Allah (swt) took prophet Muhammad (s)
to the heaven in Meraj, Allah (swt) gave some revelation to Muhammad (s). 7. In the Meraj, Allah (swt) talked to Muhammad
(s) directly like when he talked  to prophet Musa (pbuh)."
"Prophet Ibrahim (PBUH) left Egypt accompanied
by his nephew Lut (PBUH), who then went to the city of Sodom which was on the western
shore of the Dead Sea. This city was filled with evil. People of this town attacked, robbed and killed
travelers. Another huge common evil act among them was
that they were gay people. Before this nation no one didn't do this kind
of sin. This unnatural act later became known as sodomy,
after the city of Sodom. It was practiced openly and they weren't ashamed
of themselves. For their crimes and big sins, Allah (T) sent
Prophet Lut (pbuh) to guide them. But they were very arrogant and ungrateful
to Allah (T) and his messenger. Prophet Lut (pbuh) warned them about Allah's
punishment but they threatened to drive him out of the city if he kept on preaching. Animal: Why they wanted to though him out
of the city? Animal: Because they did not like prophet's
good advice. Yusuf: That's righ. He became sad for their action. They continued their gay act throughout the
land, while he struggled against them. As the many years passed, only few people
accepted his call. Not even all of his family members believed
in him. Lot's wife, like Noah's wife, was a disbeliever. Animal: So, prophet lut and prophet Noah's
were disbelivers? Yusuf: That right. So, His life was a continuous torture both
inside and outside of his home but he remained patient with his people. Years after years passed by. But his people still did not believe in him. Instead, they challenged him: Man: “If you
are truthful, bring Allah's punishment to us."". After many many years of preaching when Lut
(pbuh) lost hope, Allah (T) decided to destroy the bad people. So he sent three angels in a human form. At first they went to Prophet Ibrahim (pbuh)
to give the good news about the birth of Ishaq (pbuh). And then they went  to 
the city of Sodom, the town of Prophet Lut (pbuh). They reached the walls of the town in the
afternoon. They saw the Prophet Lut’s daughter, who
was sitting beside the river, filling her jug with water. When she lifted her face and saw them, she
was stunned to see very beautiful men on earth. One of the three angels asked her:
Angel: “Is there any place to rest?"" She knew the bad character of her people,
so she replied, ""Stay here and do not enter until I inform my father."" Leaving her jug by the river, she quickly
ran home and inform her father about that young attractive three men at the town gate. Lot felt worried as he quickly ran to his
guests. Animal: Did he recognize the Angels? Yusuf: No, he could not recognize them. He thought they were travelers, crossing this
town. He asked them where they came from and where
they were going. They did not answer his questions. Instead they asked if he could host them. He tried to convince them not to stay in this
town because people of this town were very bad. Finally Lut (pbuh) requested them to wait
until the night to go to his house, when no one would see them. As his plan, at night he guided his guests
to come to his home. The Angels inform him, that he had a very
important news for him. But prophet Lut (pbuh) told them, he don’t
know them. They inform him, they are truthful. No one saw them but as soon as prophet Lut's
wife saw them, she inform the people about their present. This news spread everywhere. All people rushed to Prophet Lut's house to
harm those very attractive guests. He was surprised to see them. When he found out that his wife informed the
people about his guests, he became very sad. Animal: She was really bad women. Yusuf: Yes, she was really bad women. To see all the people,
He shut the door, but they kept on banging on it. He requested them to leave the visitors and
fear Allah's punishment. He reminded them, their wives were lawful
for them. But people of Lut (pbuh) were very arrogant
and violent. They broke down the door. He tried to protect his guests but he was
powerless in front of those violent people. He wished for special power to protect his
guests. At that terrible moment the guests informed
him that they were angels and that violent people could not harm them. On hearing this, all the people were terrified
and fled from prophet Lut's house but they warned him before they left. The angels told him to leave his house before
sunrise, taking with him all his family members except his wife because she was disbeliever. Animal: How many people were with him, when
he left the town? Yusuf: Some scholar says, no one became Muslim
accept prophet lut and his two daughters. Allah (T) decided to destroy that most corrupted
sin city at the early morning with three different punishment. At first Allah (T) send an awful loud sound
waves to shake them all. Then the mighty power lifted the entire city,
then twisted the whole city and collapsed it on the ground. Allah (T) turned them totally upside down. Then finally he send his third punishment. A storm rain of stones on the city. Everyone and everything was destroyed, including
Lot's wife. Even today Allah (T) keeps the sign of this
punishment to warn us not to do same kind of sins what people of Lut (pbuh) used to
do. Only prophet Lut and his two daughters were
saved from that big punishment. They migrated to the town of prophet Ibrahim
(pbuh) and continued to invite people to Allah (T). He died in Palestine and was buried near Hebron. Animal: Wow, Allah (swt) was very angry with
those people. Animal2: That's why he send three different
punishment to completely destroy that nation. Yusuf: Yes, being the gay is the biggest sin
to Allah (swt). This is end of our prophet story today. Insallah next time we will learn another beautiful
story of  the prophets."
"Animals: Assalamu Alaikum. Yusuf: Walaikum Assalam. How are you children? Animals: Alhamdulillah, we are fine. We like to hear prophet stories from you. Yusuf: Ok, Mashallah. That's very good. The stories of the prophet are important for
all Muslims. Insallah, today we will learn about the story
of Prophet Noah (puh). Are you ready for that? Animals: Yessssss. Yusuf: Ok, let start. Bismillah. Prophet Noah (pbuh) was born almost 1000 years
after Adam's (pbuh) came to the earth. For many generations, Noah's people had been
worshipping statues that they called their gods. They believed that these gods would bring
them good, protect them from evil and provide all their needs. Originally when good people died among them,
Saytan inspired them to build statues in the places where they used to sit to keep their
memories alive. However they did not worship those statues. Later on when their generations turned away
from Allah (T)'s guidance, they began to worship those statues. That is how idol worshipping developed. Then Allah (T) sent prophet Noah (pbuh) to
guide his people. Noah was an excellent speaker and a very patient
man. Animals: I am trying to be good speaker and
a very patient bunny. Animals: I wish I could be very patient like
prophet Noah (pbuh). Yusuf: Insallah you could. Try your best, Inshallah Allah will help you. Prophet Noah (pbuh) spoke to his people about
Allah's greatness. He warned them not to worship anyone but Allah
(T) and described the terrible punishment Allah would give if they continued in their
evil ways. Noah's people were divided into two groups
after his warning. His words touched the hearts of the weak and
the poor but the rich and the strong became his enemy. They rejected his warning and did not believe
that he was a prophet of Allah. They thought he was just a human like themselves. When they found that his call attracted the
poor, the helpless and common laborers, the leader of those rich people tried to bargain:
Leader:""Listen Noah, be with us we are rich and powerful. Don't stay with poor and helpless people with
your faith."" However, he was gentle in his response. He refused them with his noble knowledge and
the logic of intellect. The rulers were tired of Noah's arguments. Leader:"" O Noah! If you are truthful, bring your punishment
from Allah, the one that you were telling us about."" Then prophet Noah (pbuh) replied to them,
Only Allah (swt) can bring the punishments. When He wants to punish you, you can't escape
from it. Leader: Obviously you are wrong, you are lying
to us!! Then prophet Noah (pbuh) replied to them with
gentle words, ""O my people, I am not wrong, I am a messenger of Allah. I am giving you good advice. I know something from Allah, something that
you do not know. You should only worship Allah(T) and he will
forgive your sins "" Animals: Hm.., it seems like they were very
arrogant. Animals: We are not arrogant. We are good bunnies. Yusuf: Yes, Mashallah you are a very good
bunny. But most people of Noah (pbuh) were very bad. So he continued to advise his people to believe
in Allah (T). Hours after hours, days after days, years
after years, he called them to Allah (T) day and night, in secret and in the open. But they put fingers in their ears and they
ran away from him. Noah (pbuh) continued to call his people to
believe in Allah for nine hundred and fifty years. Many generations were passing by but his number
of believers was not increasing. Because disbelievers used to teach their children
not to believe in Noah. Their children taught the next generation
the same thing. Noah (pbuh) was sad for his people. At one point when he saw that no one would
believe in him, he prayed to Allah (swt) to destroy all the disbelievers. Allah accepted Noah's prayer. He instructed Noah to build an ark. Noah (pbuh) chose a place outside the city,
far from the sea. He collected wood and tools and began working
day and night to build the ark. The disbelievers mocked and laughed at prophet
Noah. Disbeliever_1: Why are you building an ark
so far from the sea? Disbeliever_2: Are you going to drag it to
the water or is the wind going to carry it for you? Prophet Noah (pbuh) reply to them that they
would come to know pretty soon. They could not understand what was going on. They called him crazy and laughed out loud. The ship began to take shape and when it was
finished, Noah patiently waited for the command from Allah (T). Animals: Hm.. I wonder why Noah (pbuh) was building the
ark away from the sea? Animals: I wonder if there is going to be
a flood? Actually you're right. Allah (T) revealed to Noah (pbuh) that when
water miraculously flows out from the oven at Noah's house, that would be the sign of
the start of the flood, and the sign for Noah to act. The terrible day arrived when the oven at
Noah's house overflowed. Prophet Noah (pbuh) hurried to open the ark
and called all the believers to get in Ark. He also took with him a pair, of male and
female, of each type of animals, birds and insects. Seeing him taking these creatures to the ark,
the people laughed loudly. Disbeliever_1: ""Noah must have gone out of
his head! What is he going to do with those animals?"" The disbelievers did not go on board. Prophet Noah's wife and one of his sons were
not a believer, so they did not join him. Only less than 80 people joined with Prophet
Noah (pbuh) on the ark. Water rose from the cracks of the earth. The rain fell tumbling down from the sky like
never seen before on earth. Hours after hours the water level rose. The interior of the earth moved in a strange
way, and the ocean floors lifted suddenly, flooding the dry land. Noah called out to his son. ""O my son! Come with us don't join with disbelievers."" Son: "" I will climb to a high mountain, it
will save me from water."" Prophet Noah (pbuh) said, No way he could
save himself, only Allah's mercy can save him. Suddenly one big wave came and drowned his
son and wife. All the disbelievers also drowned in water. The flood had cleaned the earth and destroyed
the disbelievers. Allah (T) ordered the sky to stop the rain
and earth to swallow up all the water. The Ark rested on the Mount Judi. Prophet Noah(pbuh) was very sad and cried
to Allah (T) because of his disbeliever son and wife. Allah (T) reply to him that his son and his
wife were not part of his family because they were not believers. True family are the believers in Allah(T). Prophet Noah asked forgiveness from Allah
(T). Noah (pbuh) released all the birds, animals
and insects which scattered all over the earth. He put his forehead to the ground in prostration. The survivors lit a fire and cooked food because
during the entire period of the flood they could not cook food on Ark. A new begining was starting for human beings. From that day all the believers started their
new generation. When the death of prophet Noah's time approached
he advised his sons to worship Allah(T) alone and don't pride. This is the end of our prophet stories for
today. Inshallah, next time we will enjoy another
beautiful story of the prophets."
"Animals: Assalamu Alaikum. Yusuf: Walaikum Assalam. How are you children? Animals: Alhamdulillah, we are fine. We like to hear prophet stories from you. Yusuf: Ok, Mashallah. That's very good. The stories of the prophet are important for
all Muslims. Insallah, today we will learn about the story
of Prophet Ayub (puh). Are you ready for that? Animals: Yessssss. Yusuf: Ok, let start. Bismillah. Prophet Ayuob's English name is Prophet Job
(pbuh). In Quran Allah did not mention detail about
his message and people. Because Allah (swt) wanted to teach us different
lessons from his life which was put in very difficult test. He was from the family of Ishaq (pbuh). And his wife was from the family of Lut (pbuh). Prophet Ayub (pbuh) was very good looking
and he had very good health. In all condition, he always thankful to Allah
(T) and had patience all the time. So Allah (T) blessed him with wealth, children
and health. He always feed and clothe the poor and bought
slaves to set them free. He was very kind and gentle to others. He was an best example for the worshippers
of Allah (T). One day Allah (T) decided to test him and
his faith about Allah (T). So he destroyed prophet Ayoub's cattle, servants
and farms and make him very poor. At that condition Iblis came to him as wise
old man and tried to convince that he became poor because of too much charity and pray
to Allah is wasting time because he did not protect your wealth. But prophet Ayoub (pbuh) had very strong faith
on Allah (T). He replied Iblis that, the owner of all his
wealth was Allah (T). He was just temporary caretaker of the wealth. Prophet Ayoub prayed to Allah (T) as before. Animal: That's mean he passed the test? Yusuf: Alhamdulillah, yes he pass the test. But this time Allah (T) put him in difficult
test. He killed all of his children one by one. Than Iblis came to him in human form and tried
to convince to stop praying and reject Allah. Iblis thought this time he could win prophet
Ayoub's heart. But Ayoub (pbuh)'s strong faith in Allah (T)
reject Iblis and said, Allah (T) sometime gives and sometimes takes. He know what is good for us and what is bad
for us. So I will keep believe on my creator Allah
(T) and remain thankful to him. Prophet Ayoub (pbuh) prayed to Allah (T) as
before. Animal: So, that's mean he passed the second
test, too? Yusuf: Yes, after losing all of his lovely
children, he still keep on faith on Allah (T). This time Allah (T) put him in most hardest
test. He destroyed prophet Ayoub's Health. His body filled with disease. His skin and bone suffered with extreme pain. But he remained strong in his faith and kept
patience without any complaining. He remained hopeful of Allah(T)'s mercy. He condition was so bad that even his close
relatives and friends left him. Only his kind, loving wife stayed with him. She was very kindness and cared for him. In his many years of suffering she did not
left him. During this suffering Allah (T) protected
his heart and tongue. With these two organ he still kept glorified
the Almighty Allah (T) all the time day and night. Animal: So what the Iblis did this time? Yusuf: Iblis realized that prophet Ayoub's
faith was very strong so this time he went to Ayoub (pbuh)'s wife in the form of a man
and asked, "" Where is your husband?"" She pointed to prophet's almost lifeless body,
which was between life and death. Iblis reminded her the old days, when prophet
Ayoub's had good health, wealth and children. Suddenly the painful memory of many years
of hardship weak her and her eyes filled with tears. She came to prophet Ayoub (pbuh) and asked,
"" How long will you suffer like this? Are we to remain without wealth, children
or friends forever? Why don't you request Allah (T) to remove
this suffering?"" Prophet Ayoub (pbuh) became sad. With his soft voice he replied, Iblis must
came to her and made her unhappy. He asked her how long did he enjoy good health
and riches? She replied, "" Eighty years."" Then Ayoub (pbuh) replied: ""How long am I
suffering like this?"" She said: ""seven years."" Then Ayoub (pbuh) told her, in that case he
was ashamed to request his lord to remove the suffering because he had good life many
years but he had bad time in his life only few years. That time he was very upset on his wife. Even he swear that, if he became healthy again,
he would punish her with a hundred strokes. From that day he stop eat and drink anything
by her hand and told her to leave the house. In that condition he only seek his mercy on
Allah (T). With very sad heart she started to crying
and left him alone. He was very sad that he asked Allah (T) to
save him from the Iblis. Allah (T) accepted his call to remove his
suffering. He order prophet Ayub (pbuh) to strike the
ground with his foot. Suddenly miracle spring water came. He drink the water and washed himself with
that water. He get his good health immediately. In the meantime, his faithful wife became
very sorry and could not stay separate from his loving husband. So she returned to him. after entering the house, she was surprise
to see her husband. He became healthy again. She hugged him and thanked Allah (T) for his
mercy. He became happy to see her wife but became
worried about his oath which he took to punish her with a hundred strokes if he get his health
again. He did not wanted to hurt her. But he knew if he did not fulfill the oath,
he would be guilty of breaking a promise to Allah (T). In this difficult moment the merciful Allah
(T) solved the problem. He ordered prophet Ayub (pbuh) to strike with
a bundle of thin grass so she did not hurt. This way prophet Ayub (pbuh) fulfill his oath. So Allah (T) return his children as a double
number. And get back his wealth and more. Once when he was taking a bath, gold was falling
on him. He started to collecting them in his garment. Allah (T) called him, "" O Ayub! I made you very rich, then why are you collecting
this gold?"" He said: ""Yes, My Lord! But I cannot ignore Your Blessings. Some scholars says, he had 14 sons and 3 daughters. And lived for 99 years. But Allah knows best."
"Part 18
After hiding inside the cave of Mount Thawr, Muhammad (s), Abu Bakr, his servant Amir and
the expert travel guide, Abdullah, began their journey to Madinah during the night time. At first they started their journey south. Then they were moving west toward the Red
sea. Before reaching the Red sea, they started
their journey to the north toward Medina. After traveling a whole night and half of
the next day, they all became very tired and took a break. Muhammad (s) rested next to a big rock where
he decided to take a nap. In the meantime, Abu Bakr (pbuh) collected
some milk from a local man who was taking care of his sheep. After they were all done resting for a while,
they drank fresh milk and started their journey again. On either on the second or third day they
reached close to the town Qadid, which is 130 km for Makkah. Since they were travelling for many days,
they were all very thirsty and hungry from their long journey. On the way, they saw a woman and asked if
she could give them anything to eat or drink. She became very sorry and told them that she
did not have any food for them. At that moment, she only had a small goat
with her, but it was so weak, it did not give any milk. The prophet asked permission from the women,
to see if he could milk the goat and when he did, as a miracle, that small weak goat
started to give lots of milk. The prophet filled a large bowl with milk. At first he let the woman drink the milk. After her, everyone else drank the milk and
they became full. When all the milk was finished, the prophet
milked the goat again and left the bowl filled with milk for the woman. Afterwards when the woman’s husband returned
home, he became very surprised to see the bowl filled with milk. When the husband heard all the descriptions
from his wife, the man recognized that man was Muhammad (s) who was a true prophet. On the third day, something strange happened
in Makkah. The people heard an echoing sound in the middle
of the streets. The people could not figure out where the
voice was coming from because, that voice was coming from an Angel. That angel was telling the people of Makkah
the successful escape story of the prophet. The voice of the Angel was also saying how
the people of Makkah missed their big opportunity and their luck. When the prophet and his people left the town,
Qadid, a man named Suraqa heard about them. He made an evil plan to capture the prophet
and Abu Bakr (pbuh) and take them back to Makkah just so he could collect the big reward. As a plan Suraqa took all of his weapons and
his horse to catch them but suddenly he fell to the ground. He was very surprised and thought that maybe
it was just bad luck. But he still wanted to win those 100 camels
as his reward. He again sat on his horse and went after the
prophet to catch him. Just when he was very close to them, he heard
the prophet reciting from the Quran as he was walking without any worries. The prophet didn’t even look back. But Abu Bakr (pbuh) became very scared and
looked back. At that time suddenly, the horse’s legs
sank into the sand and Suraqa fell into the ground. He tried very hard to pull the horse’s legs
out of the sand. When he did pull up the horse’s legs, dust
started to rise from that hole, which looked like smoke. He immediately realized that something was
wrong. Finally, he realized that it was impossible
to catch the prophet. He gave up and wanted to help the prophet
and his people by giving some food. However, the prophet did not accept it and
requested Suraqa not to tell the people about their location. Suraqa kept the prophet’s request and did
not tell anyone about the prophet’s location. Along the way the prophet met a group of 70
to 80 travelers and their leader was Burida. After seeing the prophet they all accepted
Islam and prayed their evening prayer together. Burida and his group kept on going but later
on he and his people moved to Medina after the Battle of Uhud to join the other Muslims. Later, as the prophet reached the town of
Arj, the prophet met Abu Tamim along his journey. He also became a Muslim. When the Abu Tamim met the prophet, he noticed
that one of their camels became very weak. So Abu Tamim gave the prophet another camel,
along with a servant named Mas’ood to help the prophet reach Medina. When the prophet reached the valley of Reem,
he met Zubayr (pbuh) with some Muslims who were returning from a business trip in Syria. Zubayr was so happy see them, that he gave
some white clothes to the prophet and Abu Bakr (pbuh) as a gift. Finally, after seven long days of their journey,
on Monday 8th Rabiul Awal, or in the English 23rd of September, in the year of 622 AD,
prophet Muhammad (s) reached the town of Qubaa, which was the border town of Medina. The Muslims from Medina and the surrounding
areas were anxiously waiting for Muhammad (s). Every day, they went out in the open hilly
area and waited for Muhammad (s) until noon-time. When it was noon time, the sun was directly
on top of them so they became very hot and returned to their homes. One day the people returned to their homes
after waiting for a long time for the prophet. A Jew went on top of a hill to a hill and
suddenly from the distance he saw a small group of people who were wearing white clothes
, as they were coming to the direction of Medina. That Jewish man called out to the Muslims
to tell them the good news. All of the Muslims ran out from their homes
to see the prophet from afar and while making sounds to welcome the prophet. The Muslims of Qubaa were also making the
welcoming sound for the prophet. So he stopped there in the town of Qubaa,
and turned to the right which was the tribe of Amr bin Auf. Muhammad (s) became very happy to see the
Muslims' reception. Almost all of the people from Medina and Qubaa
came to see him. During the 14th year of prophet hood finally
Muhammad (s) saw that Islam found it's first safe place. He stayed there for 4 days in the house of
Kulthoom. By that time Ali (pbuh) also came from Makkah
to Qubaa and meet Muhammad (s). In that time the prophet started the first
mosque of Islam in Qubaa and prayed there with the Muslims. Today that Mosque called the 'Masjid Quba'a'. On 5th day, which was Friday, many people
came from Madina to welcome Muhammad (s) to their own town Medina. On the way it was the time to pray the Friday
group prayer. Muhammad (s) led the prayer with about a hundred
of Muslims around him. The place where the prophet led the jummah
prayer was later made into a masjid called ' Masjid al jummah'. After the Jummah prayer Muhammad (s) started
his journey again so he could finally enter the blessed city. Before the city of Medina was called Yathrib. However, after the prophet entered the city,
the people started to call the city, 'Madina tur Rasul' which meant, the city of the prophet. So in short people called it Madina. Happy crowds of men, women and children were
waiting and welcome the last prophet Muhammad (s). As he made his entrance, they sang their beautiful
welcoming song and even today, Muslims sing the same song in the happy memory of that
day."
"Yusuf: Assalamu Alaikum. Animals: Walaikum Assalam. We come to hear the Prophet Stories. Yusuf: Ok, Masllah. That's very good. Insallah, today I will try to tell the story
about Prophet Idris (puh). His biblical name is Enoch (puh). Are you ready for that? Animals: Yessssss. Yusuf: Ok, let start. Bismillah. After Prophet Adam and his son Seth (PU them)
died, people were start to forget Allah(T)'s commands. Then He send Idris (puh) as a prophet for
human guidance. He was the 5th generation of the Prophet Adam,
born and raised in Babylon. He called his people back to their forefathers
religion, but only a few of them listened to him. The majority turned away from him. At that time the children of Adam spread all
over the world. Allah (T) guide the Prophet Idris and his
followers left Babylon and move to Egypt. There he carried on his mission, calling people
to what is just and fair, teaching them certain prayers 
and instructing them to fast on certain days and to give a portion of their wealth to the
poor. He was the 1st to invent the basic form of
writing. This is the end of our today's prophet story,
Insallah, next time we will enjoy another beautiful prophet story."
"Part 13: Splitting of the Moon
InshaAllah, in this episode we will discuss another creation of Allah (swt) and their
prophet. As we know Allah (swt) created millions and
billions number of creations. There are so many creations that we could
not ever finish counting them. Every one of his creations follow Allah (swt)'s
laws. But among them only two of his creations are
different and special. And those two creations are Human and Jinn. They can do whatever they want to do. They are free to do either good or bad jobs. Since all of the other creations that Allah
(swt) created doesn't have that kind of freedom, on the day of judgment, for Humans and Jinns,
Allah (swt) will punish those who did the bad job and give reward who did the good job
for their entire life time in the afterlife. However, Allah (swt) is merciful and he doesn’t
want us to go to the wrong path. So in order to guide us, he sent many prophets,
so we can go to heaven and get our rewards. Animal: So what about the Jinns? Who was their Prophets? Yusuf: Between Human and Jinn, Allah (swt)
gave the highest position to the humans. So Allah (swt) did not send any prophets for
the Jinns. Every single Human Prophets that were ever
sent, they are also the Prophets for the Jinns. Animal: So, Muhammad (s) was also the prophet
for the Jinns? Yusuf: Yes, Muhammad (s) was also the last
Prophet for the Jinns. In this episode we will see how Allah (swt)
made Muhammad (s) the last prophet for the Jinns. So let's start our story for today. It was the time when Muhammad (s) was going
back to Makkah after visiting the city of Ta'if. During the middle of that journey, Muhammad
(s) took rest in a place for few days. One morning the prophet was praying Fajr prayer. At that time a group of Jinns, who are made
by fire, heard Muhammad (s) reciting the Qur'an. That group of Jinns were very amazed to hear
the Qur'an from Muhammad (s). They immediately accepted Muhammad (s) as
a prophet and believed that Allah (s) was their true God. When the prayer was finished, those group
of the Jinns returned to their town and told the other Jinns about the new revelation,
the Qur'an, and the last prophet Muhammad (s). They told all the Jinns to accept Allah (swt)
as their God and Muhammad (s) as their last prophet. Animal: Did Muhammad (s) know about that group
of Jinn, who were listening him during the prayer? Yusuf: No, at that time our prophet Muhammad
(s) did not know about those group of Jinns. Later Allah (swt) told Muhammad (s) about
that event in Surah Ahqaf and Surah jinn. After a few days, Muhammad (s) started his
journey to his hometown of Makkah. But at that time Muslims were very weak in
Makkah. He did not want to enter Makkah without any
protection. So he waited at Hira cave and sent a man to
some of the leaders of Makkah and requested some protection so that the bad people could
not harm Muhammad (s). Finally a leader, Mut'im, who was not a Muslim,
agreed to give protection to Muhammad (s). Mut'im and his sons armed themselves and waited
for Muhammad (s) to give him their protection. Then, the prophet happily entered the city
with their help. He directly entered the Kabah and prayed a
short prayer and then went home with the help of Mut'im and his sons' protection. Animal: Mut'im did a very good job. Did he become a Muslim? Yusuf: No, he did not become Muslim. But
Muhammad (s) was very grateful for his support. As usual, the bad people from Makkah tried
very hard to prove Muhammad (s) as a false prophet. Allah (swt) showed the people many different
kinds of proof that Muhammad (s) was the true prophet but the bad people still could not
believe in Prophet Muhammad (s). One day some of the bad people called Muhammad
(s) at the Kabah. The people asked him to show them a big miracle
to prove his prophethood, like the other prophets such as Musa, Saleh or Isa (pbut) all. They requested him to turn Mount Safa into
gold or move the mountains to another place or break the sky and many other crazy demands. They promised that if Muhammad (s) could do
such a thing, they would become a Muslim. The prophet prayed to Allah (swt) to show
a big miracle so that the bad people would accept Islam. Allah (swt) said, that the bad people would
not become Muslims, even if Allah showed them a big miracle. Because without Allah (swt)'s blessing, no
one could be a Muslim. As Allah (swt)'s order, Muhammad (s) told
them, the most powerful is Allah and a prophet is just a human. Hearing that the people were starting to think
that Muhammad (s) was not true prophet, and that's why he could not show the miracle. In that situation Allah (swt) gave Muhammad
(s) a special ability to show a great miracle. In front of many people, the Prophet Muhammad
(s) broke the moon into two pieces. Each piece was on either sides of Mount Hira. Everybody was shocked to see that and could
not believe on their eyes. So they thought it must be a magic and they
broke their promise to accept Islam."
"When two of Muhammad (s)'s greatest supporters
Abu Talib and Khadijah (pbuh) died, the bad Quraysh got the chance to insult Muhammad
(s) everywhere. Once a very bad man came to Muhammad (s) and
threw dust on his head. When the prophet went back to his house, one
of his daughters started to cry and helped him wash out his head. Muhammad (s) told his daughter not to worry
for him because Allah (swt) would always protect him. In that situation Muhammad (s) needed someone
to take-care of the family. One day, one of his neighbor, who was a woman
came to Muhammad (s) with a marriage proposal with Saudah and Aishah (pbut). Saudah (pbuh) was a widow and she had at least
5 children. She, and her ex husband became Muslims during
the beginning times of Islam. During the hard times that the Quraysh were
giving them, they had to migrate to Abyssinia or Ethiopia with the second group of Muslims
who escaped from Makkah. After a few years her husband died. She and her family had to face a very hard
time for Islam. Saudah (pbuh) was one of the great women that
Allah (swt) chose as Muhammad (s)'s wife. Animal: So Saudah (pbuh) was Muhammad (s)'s
second wife? Yusuf: Yes, Saudah (pbuh) was Muhammad (s)'s
second wife. But
Allah (swt) had another plan for the future of Islam. Every movement of Muhammad (s)'s life was
important to understand the Islamic way of life. So, that meant his very private life was also
very important for Muslims to know. For this great plan Allah (swt) chose Ayesha
(pbuh). From her childhood, she was very bright and
smart. She was also very beautiful and came from
a very noble family. Her father’s name was Abu Bakar (pbuh) who
was a very close friend of Muhammad (s) and who was also the first Khalifa of Islam. At that time people used to get married very,very
early. When Muhammad (swt) lost his first wife, Khadijah
(pbuh), Ayesha (pbuh) was around 6 years old. Even though she was really young, there were
many people came with marriage proposals, all asking for her hand. But Allah (swt) made her a very special women
in history. In the same way Allah (swt) made prophet Jesus
(pbuh)’s mother Mariyam (pbuh) special. So for Allah (swt)'s plan Muhammad (s) had
to marry Ayesha (pbuh). Animal: But she was a little girl who was
only 6 years old. She did not know anything about how to take
care of a family. Animal: Wait, at that time, did she even reach
maturity yet? Yusuf: No, she had not reached her maturity
at that time. That's why the prophet did not start a family
with her at that time. When she reached her maturity as Allah (swt)'s
plan, the prophet started a family with her. Basically in the present time, you can consider
that at the age of 6 years old, Ayesha (pbuh) was engaged with the prophet. And when she was 9 years old, they started
their married life as Allah (swt)'s great plan. She was married to the prophet for only about
9 years. During that early time, it is the best time
to learn any type of education. Ayesha (pbuh) started her education when she
was 9 years old, which she learned from her husband Muhammad (s)'s life and continue her
education about Islam until Muhammad (s)'s death when she was only 18 years old. And that's why in history, she had the 3rd
biggest collection of hadiths in Islam. And topics that covers women's issues, she
had the number 1 biggest Hadith collection in Islam. No other wife of Muhammad (s) collected that
many Hadith like Ayesha (pbuh) did. She was the greatest female scholar of Islam. Animal: MashaAllah, she did a great job for
Islam! So, what happened to Muhammad (s) after Abu
Talib and Khadija (pbuh)'s death? After Abu Talib and Khadija (pbuh)'s death,
it was very difficult for Muhammad (s) to talk about Islam to the people of Makkah. So he decided to go outside of Makkah to invite
the people to Islam. As a plan, Muhammad (s) and his adopted son,
Zayd (pbuh) started their journey to Ta'if by walking. It was almost 60 miles east from Makkah. On his way, whenever he saw any tribe, he
invited them to Islam. But the people rejected him as a prophet. Finally they reached the city of Ta'if. At first he met 3 brothers who were the leaders
of Ta'if. The prophet invited them to Islam and requested
to help him spread Islam to their people. But those 3 brothers became very angry and
rude with the prophet and removed him out from their land. Muhammad (s) became very sad for their very
bad behavior. He was in that town for 10 days. In that time, he met all of the other leaders
and met with many people to talk about Islam. But unfortunately not even a single person
accepted Islam. Instead they forced him to leave Ta'if. Animal: It’s so sad to see that the people
of Ta'if were really bad! All of the bad people started to give hard
time. They even let their children go to give a
hard time to the prophet. On the last day, a group of very bad people
and their children ran after the prophet. They started to abuse the prophet and started
throwing stones at him. Because of those stones, his feet started
to bleed so Zayd (pbuh) tried very hard to protect Muhammad (s). Both of them had to run out from that place. Three miles from that place, finally they
found a garden to take a rest. At that time Muhammad (s) was very extremely
tired and he had pain all over his body. It was one of the worst days of prophet Muhammad
(s)'s life. He was feeling extremely sad because of how
the bad people behaved with him, so he prayed to the one and only God Allah (swt) to give
him strength and support him through this difficult time. He also asked Allah (swt) not to be angry
with him. When the owners of the garden saw Muhammad
(s) and Zayd (pbuh), they felt really bad and sent some grapes and sent it to them by
one of their slaves. The prophet took those grapes and after saying
Bismillah, which means in the name of Allah, he started to eat. When the prophet said the word Bismillah,
that attracted the slave person. When the slave told him that he was Christian
and he was from Nineveh, Iraq, Muhammad (s) reminded him about prophet Yunus or Jonah
(pbuh), who was also from the same city Nineveh, Iraq and recited some of the Quranic verses
about Yunus (pbuh). Muhammad (s) also told him, he was a prophet
like Yunus (pbuh). The slave was very surprised and happy to
hear that and became a Muslim. Animal: MashaAllah, a true Christian easilly
recognized the true prophet from Allah (swt). After that, Muhammad (s) and Zayd (pbuh) started
their journey back to Makkah. At that time Muhammad (s) was very tired and
hearted broken because of the people of Ta'if's bad behavior. In the middle of their journey, the prophet
noticed that there was a huge cloud following them. When he looked up he saw Angel Jibrael (pbuh)
up there. Beside him, there was another angel. That other angel is the one who controls the
mountains. They told Muhammad (s) that, Allah (swt) sent
them to fulfill his wish. If Muhammad (s) wanted the angels to destroy
the city of Ta'if, the angel of Mountain would destroy the city of Ta'if with the big mountains. But the prophet forgave the people of Ta'if
and prayed for them to become Muslims. Jibrael (pbuh)'s visit made Muhammad (s) very
happy and he became mentally stronger to spread Islam."
"Mi'raaj &amp; Israa:
As  you know by tenth year of Muhammad (s)'s prophet
hood, his life became very difficult. Because of the non believers' cruel torture
and boycott, the Muslims became very weak. And later, because both his uncle Abu Talib
and wife Khadija (pbuh)'s died, Muhammad (s) had lost his two of biggest supporters. Then right after that there was also the failure
when he went to the city of Tai'f. According to some historians, by that time
there were only around 70 Muslims all together. And because of that, it seemed like the prophet’s
great mission was failing, which was to bring the people to the one and only God, Allah
(swt). Things were getting extremely difficult, and
then a great miracle happened, the Israa and Mi’raj . Those were the two miracle nights
of a Journey with a beautiful heavenly baby white horse, called 'Buraq'. Israa was known as the Journey between the
Ka'bah and Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, Palestine. During that old time the Al-Aqsa mosque was
known as the Solomon's Temple. And the Mi'raj was known as the Journey between
Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Heaven. Allah (swt) mentioned about that night in
Surah Isra verse 1, or another name of that surah is Surah is Bani Israel. The details of this story is very big. That's why we found several different versions
of the stories from different Sahabas in the great Tafsir Ibn Kasir. After a really long time of studying and researching
this story, InshaAllah, we will try to tell you the most logical version of the story
from Ibn Kasir, but as always, Allah (swt) know the best. Between the 10th and the 13th year of Muhammad
(s)'s prophethood, one night in Makkah, after praying his Isha prayer the prophet was taking
a rest next to the Kabah. At that time Angel Jibrail (pbuh) came with
a small white horse, and it was called Al Buraq. The angel requested Muhammad (s) to ride the
Buraq. Instantly the Buraq started to fly!! One step of the magical creature covered a
great long distance. And because of that, within a very short time
they reached the holy place, which was the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Then prophet Muhammad (s) went inside the
mosque and prayed 2 Rakat as way to respect the Mosque . That prayer that he prayed is
called Tahiyyat al-masjid prayer. Then Jibrail (pbuh) offered a glass of milk
and a glass of wine to Muhammad (s) as a guest. The prophet rejected the glass of wine and
instead accepted the milk. Jibrael (pbuh) became very happy and said
that was a very good decision to accept milk and reject the wine. Animal: So, his journey was over after visited
Al Aqsa Mosque? Even though the prophet was on a journey from
Makkah to the Masjid-Al Aqsa, there was still another journey that was waiting for Muhammad
(s). Then after they were well rested, Angel Jibriel
and the prophet started their journey to the sky. When they reached the first sky, Jibrael (pbuh)
requested the door Angels to open the sky door. After enter through the 1st door, Muhammad
(s) saw our father of all mankind, Prophet Adam (pbuh). They were both very happy and gave Salam to
each other. Muhammad (s) saw that all of the good people's
souls were on Prophet Adam's one side and all the bad people's souls were on his other
side. Muhammad (s) was very happy to see all of
the good people's souls but when he saw all the bad people's souls, he became very sad
and started to cry. Muhammad (s) and Jibrael (pbut) continued
on with their journey to the second sky. Jibrael (pbuh) again requested the door angels
to open the gate. After entering the second sky Muhammad (s)
saw two prophets, Isa, or in English, Jesus and Yahya (pbut). They all gave salam to each other when they
all met. Then Muhammad (s) and Jibrael (pbut) moved
their journey up to the 3rd sky. After the 3rd sky gate opened Muhammad (s)
met with the most beautiful and handsome prophet in the world which was Yusuf (pbuh). At the 4th sky Prophet Muhammad (s) met prophet
Idris (pbuh). Then at the 5th sky the prophet met Haroon
(pbuh). Great prophet Musa (pbuh) was on the 6th sky. When he saw prophet Muhammad (s), he started
to cry and said his followers were less who enter the heaven. But young prophet Muhammad (s)'s more followers
will go to the heaven. When Muhammad (s) reached the 7th sky, he
saw prophet Ibrahim (pbuh) was resting next to Bait Al-Ma'mur Mosque, which is located
directly on top of the Kaaba. Everyday only 70 thousand angels are allowed
to pray in this Mosque and they get a chance only once a lifetime. Animal: How does the Bait Al-Ma’mur mosque
look like? According to some scholars Bait Al-Ma'mur
is looks like the Kabah. But Allah (swt) knows the best. After meeting prophet Ibrahim (pbuh), they
both went to the highest point of limit in all of creation, Sidrat Al-Muntaha, the biggest
tree in Paradise and also in the entire creation of the world. The size of It's fruits and leaves were extremely
big. It was covered by golden butterflies. It was so beautiful that no one can ever explain
it. Over there Muhammad (s) saw Jibrael (pbuh)
in his real form and shape. He was very big and and the prophet saw that
Angel Jibrael has 600 wings. At that point Allah (swt) talk to Muhammad
(s). According to some scholars, Angel Jibrael
(pbuh) stopped there and Muhammad (s) went beyond the tree to talk to Allah (swt). But Allah (swt) knows the best. Animal: Did Muhammad (s) see Allah (swt) with
his own eyes? No, Muhammad (s) did not see Allah (swt). No human eye cannot ever see Allah (swt). Allah (swt) talked with him like Musa (pbuh)
and gave a special message to the Muslims. Allah and Muhammad (s) were there talking
about the daily prayer. From Sahih Muslim Hadith we know, At that
point, Allah (swt) gave 3 things to Muhammad (swt). 1. Daily prayer for Muslims. 2. The Last two verses of the Surah Baqara.
3. The Merciful Allah (swt) would forgive every
sin of Muslims, but if some ones makes any partner with Allah (swt), he will not forgive
their sins. At first the daily prayer was fifty times
a day. After receiving Allah (swt)'s message, Muhammad
and Jibrael (pbut) started their journey to come back to the earth. On their way Musa (pbuh) stopped them and
wanted to know what the special message was. When Musa (pbuh) knew about the fifty times
daily prayer, he advised Muhammad (s) to go back to Allah (swt) and request to have less
of daily prayers. Muhammad (s) did not know what to do. Then he turned to Jibrael (pbuh) for his advice. Jibrael (pbuh) told Muhammad (s) that he can
go back and request for less prayer. So then they went back to the Sidrat Al-Muntaha
and requested Allah (swt) for less number of prayers. Allah (swt) accepted his request and lowered
it to 10 times of daily prayers and then started their journey to Makkah. Again Musa (pbuh) stopped them and advised
him to ask to make it less daily prayers. Muhammad (s) again went back and requested
Allah (swt) for less prayer. This time as a gift to Muslims, Allah (swt)
gave only five times of daily prayer. Again on the way Musa (pbuh) stopped them
and advised for less. He told Allah (swt) asked to do less for his
people but still his people did not do their duties. At that point Muhammad (s) did not feel comfortable
to go back again and ask for less daily prayers. Suddenly Allah (swt) voice told it was a easy
order to follow for us( in his head). Allah (swt) also said that if we pray our
5 times prayer a day, Allah (swt) will give us the same reward as praying 50 times a day. And his order is final. Animal: So, did he see any other things during
the Journey? During the journey of the Mi’raj, Jibrael
(pbuh) showed hell and heaven to Muhammad (s). Scholars had different opinion about that
but Allah (swt) knows the best. Jibrael (pbuh) showed the most beautiful Kawusar
river and stream, which Allah (swt) gave Muhammad (s) as a gift after his youngest son Abdullah
died. On his journey he also saw the angel named
Malik without smile, that was the angel who was the guard for hell. In different Hadith we know Allah (swt) showed
some examples for bad people's punishment. Muhammad (s) return to Al-Aqsa Mosque before
the morning prayer, Fajar time. All the prophet were coming and got together
for morning prayer. Fajr prayer was the first mandatory prayer
that Allah (swt) gave to Muhammad (s) little early. Angel Jibrael (pbuh) asked Muhammad (s) to
lead the prayer, and because of that it was (proof) indication that prophet Muhammad (s)
was the leader of all the prophets. Then after the prayer Jibrael (pbuh) and Muhammad
(s) started their Journey to Makkah. On their way Muhammad (swt) saw a group of
people who were coming to the Makkah. They return back to Makkah before sunrise. This is the end of Muhammad (s) miracle journey
of the Israa and the Mi’raj. Inshallah in next episode we will know what
happened after that."
"Yusuf: Assalamu Alaikum. Ok, Mashallah. That's very good. The  stories of the prophet are important for all
Muslims. Insallah, today we will learn about the story
of Prophet ____ Yunus buh). Are you ready for that? Ok, let start. Bismillah. Prophet Jonah also known as Yunus in Arabic
(pbuh) was also known as Dhan-Nun. The people of the town of Nineveh had more
than hundred thousand people. They used to worship the idols and did not
believe in Allah (swt). They also lived a shameless life. To guide those people, Allah (swt) sent Prophet
Yunus, (pbuh). He taught them to worship the only God Allah
(swt). The people did not like his advice because
they were used to doing their own way of worship, so they argued. ""We and our forefathers have worshipped these
gods for many years and no harm has come to us."" He tried to convince them that it was foolish
of them to worship the idols and to follow Allah's laws but they ignored him. He also warned them that if they kept on with
their foolishness, Allah's punishment would come soon. But they were very bad people, they told prophet
Yunus (pbuh) that they were not afraid of his threats. They told him
""Let it happen,"". Prophet Yunus (pbuh) became very sad and angry,
he said to them, ""in that case, I will leave you alone!"" He was very angry at them. He lost his hope on his people. He thought Allah (swt)'s punishment would
come to his people in any time. So he left his people and tried to leave away
from his town Nineveh, where Allah (swt) appointed him as a prophet to guide those people. He hardly left the city when the skies began
to change color and looked as if they were on fire. When the people saw that they started to fear. They tried to remember the stories of 'Ad,
Thamud and Noah. Animal: What are the stories of Ad and Thamud? Yusuf: Who can tell me the story of Ad? Animal: I can tell. The story of Ad is the story of prophet Hud
(as). Yusuf: Mashallah, And the story of Thamud? Animal : I can tell, the story of Thamud is
the story about Prophet Salih (as). Yusuf: Mashallah, that's very good. Let's come back to our story. When they see the punishment was coming from
Allah (swt) to destroy them all like people of Ad, and Thamud, their hearts were filled
with faith of Allah (swt). Everybody in the town, adults and children
gathered in the mountains and started to cry to get mercy and forgiveness from their creator
Allah (swt). Their loud cry reflected on the mountains
and filled with an echo sound. In that crucial moment their sincere apology
from their heart were accepted by Allah (swt). He removed his anger and blessed them once
again. Animal: Why did Allah (swt) forgive them,
and not the people of Ad or Thamud? Yusuf: Because every single person from the
town asked Allah (swt)'s forgiveness. If anyone asked forgiveness from their heart,
Allah (swt) will forgive them. That's why Allah (swt) is merciful. We can always ask forgiveness from him. He loves to forgive people. But we are lazy to ask forgiveness from him. Animal: Then what's happened? Yusuf: When Allah (swt) removed the storm
from them, they prayed  for the return of prophet Yunus to guide them. But prophet Yunus (pbuh) was far from the
town and got in a small passengers ship to cross the sea. It sailed all day in calm waters with a good
wind blowing at the sails. When night came, the sea suddenly changed. A horrible storm blew as if it were going
to break the ship into pieces. The waves were very big and wild. They rose up as high as the mountains. In the mean time Allah (swt) sent one of the
biggest whale in the ocean, who was the right behind the ship and kept his mouth open and
obeyed Allah (swt) to follow the ship. They did not know what to do. The chief crewman asked others to lighten
the ship's heavy load, so they threw their baggage in the water but that was not enough
for their safety. At that time non believers thought the sea
and the wind were some of their gods. They decided to please their angry gods by
throwing the people one by one in the sea but that was very hard for them to choose
whom they will throw at first. So they drew a lottery among themselves. Whose name would come out he would be thrown
into the sea. When they started to draw the lottery prophet
Yunus (pbuh) name appeared. But they knew he was a good and most honorable
person among themselves. So they did not throw him to the sea. They started to draw the lottery a second
time. Again prophet Yunus (pbuh) name appeared. They wanted to give him one more chance. In the 3rd time again his name came up again. That time prophet Yunus (pbuh) realized that
Allah (swt)'s hand was in all this because he did not take permission from Allah (swt)
to leave the mission for his people. When he realized the storm was because of
him, he stood at the edge of the ship and threw himself in to the sea by the name of
Allah (swt). Immediately, he disappeared in a huge wave
and the whale waiting for him swallowed him into his stomach. By Allah (swt)'s order the whale took prophet
Yunus (pbuh) to the bottom of the sea, in the darkness of the night, prophet Yunus (pbuh)
imaged himself to be dead, but when he could move he realized that he was alive. Allah (swt) put him in three level of darkness. Who can tell me the three level of darkness? Animal: I can tell, one was the darkness of
night And another one was the darkness of whale stomach. Animal: I know the third one, the darkness
of the bottom of the sea. Yusuf: Mashallah, that's good. In that darkness he was scared of Allah (swt). He was very sorry for his mistake. He prostated to Allah (swt) in the belly of
the whale and recited the very powerful dua for his pardon. Do you know that dua? Animal: Yes, I know. La ilaha illa Anta… Yusuf: Do you know the meaning of this? Animal: ""There is no god but you: glory to
you, I was indeed wrong!"" Yusuf: Mashallah. That is very powerful dua Allah (swt) teaches
us through Prophet Yunus (pbuh). He continued praying to Allah (swt) and started
to become sick in the belly of whale. His skin was affected with the acids of the
whale stomach. When Allah (swt) saw the sincere repentance
of Prophet Yunus (pbuh), he commanded the whale to release Prophet Yunus (pbuh) onto
an island. When he was release on the shore, he was very
ill, and the sun's heat burned his affected skin. To protect Prophet Yunus (pbuh) Allah (swt)
grew a plant to protect him from the sun's heat. In short Allah (swt) recovered him and forgave
him. And told him he was saved because he prayed
to Allah (swt) regularly. Otherwise he would be in the whale's stomach
till the Day of Judgment. After that he regained his strength he found
his way to his hometown, Nineveh. He was surprised to see the change of his
people. The entire population became Muslims and accepted
him as a prophet. Together they prayed to Allah (swt) for his
mercy. This is the end of our prophet story today."
"2. Muhammad (pbuh) childhood
Abdul Muttalib took the newborn baby to the Kabah for Allah (swt)'s blessings. He named the baby Muhammad, which means ""he
who I praised"". That was a very unique name at that time. On the seventh day his head was shaved and
he was circumcised. Then Abdul Muttalib invited all of his neighbors
to a dinner. During that time people of Makkah let their
newborn babies live with their babysitter who lived in the hilly desert area. That made the babies stronger and healthier. Those babysitters used have the most purest
form of the Arabic language. It also helped the babies to learn the best
Arabic language. One time, some of the babysitters came to
Makkah from BanuSa'd tribe to choose the babies that they would be taking care of. Halema and her husband Harith bin Abdul Uzzah
(pbut) was in that group. They were very poor. On their journey they had a very weak donkey. So they were very behind from the rest of
the group. Abdul Muttalib asked every babysitter to take
care of baby Muhammad (pbuh). But when they knew Abdul Muttalib could not
give them enough money, so they refused him. They were busy to take care of the rich peoples'
children. Halema was very late to reach Makkah. So she could not find any of the rich people's
children. However she did not want to go back home without
a baby. So she took Muhammad (pbuh) with her, and
from that moment, their life changed instantly. Their weak donkey started to run fast to Halema's
house. Animal: Did Allah (swt) gave any reward to
Halema (R) because of Muhammed (swt)? Yusuf: Yes, her family was blessed by Allah
(swt). Their animals started to give lots of milk
and there was no more hunger in her family. Even during the very dry season their animals
gave lots of milk but the other families couldn't even get a drop of milk from their animal. For Halima (pbuh), it was very easy to take
care baby Muhammad (pbuh). She was very happy with him. After every six months Halemah took Muhammad
(pbuh) to Makkah to his family. Halema breastfeed Muhammed (pbuh) up until
he was two years old. She requested his mother to keep him a little
longer. Muhammad (pbuh)'s family was also happy with
Halema for taking care their baby in a good way because at that time Makkah was not a
very healthy place to raise little kids. So Muhammed (pbuh) still continued to stay
with Halima's family. One day he was playing with some children
near Halema's house. He was only 4 years old when suddenly angel
Jibreel, or in English, Gabriel (pbuh) came to them and held the boy Muhammed (pbuh). The other kids became scared and ran away. Angel Jibreel layed down Muhammed (pbuh) and
opened his chest. Jibreel (pbuh) took out his heart and cut
off some of the parts so that it would save him from Satan. Then he washed his heart with Zamzam water
and put his heart back into its place. Everyone thought Muhammed (pbuh) had been
killed. Animal: Was there any sign on his chest? Yusuf: Yes, his chest had the sign of the
cut. Everyone was very scared. Halima did not feel safe to keep Muhammed
(pbuh) with her anymore. So she brought him back to Makkah to his mother
Amina. Muhammed (pbuh) got the love from his mother
for the next two years. When Muhammed (pbuh) became six years old,
his mother wanted to visit Madina, where her husband, Muhammed (pbuh)'s father died. Finally Muhammed (saw), his grandfather Abdul
Muttalib, his mother Amina and their slave Umm Ayman started their journey to Madinah. It was around 5 hundred km of journey. They stayed over there around one month and
then started their journey back to Makkah. When they reached at the middle way at Abwa
city, his mother Aminah became very sick and died. She was buried over there. The little boy Muhammed (pbuh) lost his mother
and had become an orphan. His grandfather Abdul Muttalib became very
sad for Muhammed (pbuh). He loved him so much. He took care of Muhammed (pbuh) every moment
for the next two years. Then a terrible thing happened. At the age of eight, his grandfather Abdul
Muttalib became sick and died. Muhammed (pbuh) lost his last shelter. He became very sad without his father, mother
and grandfather. His Uncle Abu Talib loved him so much. Abu Talib was poor but he was very happy to
take care Muhammed (pbuh). Animal: Did Muhammad (s) showed any miracle
in his young age? Muhammad (s) miracle started from his young
age. One time there was a very long dry season. There was no rain for a very long time. Every single family had food shortage because
of the drought. Since Abu Talib was the leader of the Quryash
the people came to him hoping he would know what to do. Abu Talib took Muhammad (s) to the center
of the town and stood by the wall of the kabbah. At that time Muhammad (s) was glowing like
the sun. People saw a black cloud was over his head. Both of them started to pray for the rain. Immediately from different directions, clouds
started to come and join together. Heavy rain started to pour down miraculously
after a long time. Crops started to grow and Allah (swt) solved
their food problem. Animal: During his childhood, was there any
special sign that the people could recognize that he would be a prophet later on? Yusuf: Yes, he had lots of signs that he would
become a prophet. Let me tell you one story. When Muhammad (s) was a twelve year boy. His uncle Abu Talib took him to Syria for
a business trip. When they were entering the city of Bosra,
a Priest saw the trees and stones bent down for the young boy, Muhammad (s). He was surprise to see that. He knew tree and stone bent down only for
prophets. When they were taking a rest, the priest came
to them and recognized the future prophet Muhammad (s). He held Muhammad (s)’s hand and said this
boy would be a prophet and bring kindness for all people. Abu Talib was surprise and asked how he knew
about that. He replied he had the knowledge from the bible. He also mentioned that Muhammad (s) had the
seal of prophet hood which was below his shoulder, like an apple. He also requested Abu Talib to send back Muhammad
(s) to Makkah for safety because if some people found out that information they might try
to kill him. Abu Talib immediately sent him back to Makkah
with some of his trusted people."
"Animals: Assalamu Alaikum. Yusuf: Walaikum Assalam. How are you children? Animals: Alhamdulillah, we are fine. We like to hear prophet stories from you. Yusuf: Ok, Mashallah. That's very good. The stories of the prophet are important for
all Muslims. Last time we learned the first part of Prophet
Musa (pbuh)’s story. Inshallah, today we will learn about the second
part of Prophet Musa (pbuh)’s story. Are you ready for that? Animals: Yessssss. Yusuf: Ok, let start. Bismillah. Allah (swt) show many miracle to evil Pharaoh. Yet he kept torture the Bani Israel. It was clear that Pharaoh would never believe
in Allah (swt) and Musa (pbuh). Finally, Allah (swt) told prophet Musa (pbuh)
to leave Egypt secretly with his people at night. People of Bani Israel prepared themselves
to leave Egypt and follow Musa and Harun (pbut). They didn't know where to go at the night
time but Allah (swt) guided them to the Gulf of Suez. Because he had a different plan. That event known as Exodus. Pharaoh got the news about children of Israel. So Pharaoh became very angry and sent his
people to different cities to gather solders to join with him. Pharaoh repeatedly told them,
""They are a small group of people. They have made us angry but we are ready to
defeat them."" They were ready to catch the children of Israel
but they waited until morning to bring them back to slavery. This way Allah (swt) removed them from all
of their assets, the beautiful houses and gardens. On the other side, the Bani Israel were waiting
at the shore of Gulf of Suez. Animal: How many Bani Israel Joined with Prophet
Musa (as)? Yusuf: It was a huge gathering. Some historian say, more than 20 thousand
Bani Israel joined with him but Allah (swt) knows best. When they heard Pharaoh and his army were
coming to catch them, they became scared. Some of them even lost their patience and
faith on prophet Musa (pbuh). They were willing to surrender themselves
to the Pharaoh. For children of Israel, that moment was a
test for their faith in Allah (swt). In front of them was the Gulf of Suez and
behind them were their enemy, the Pharaoh and his strong army. It was a death trap for them. Prophet Musa and Harun (pbut) did not know
what to do. They were waiting for Allah (swt)'s guidance. In that difficult moment, Allah (swt) ordered
prophet Musa (pbuh) to hit the Gulf water with his stick. Then one of biggest miracle happened in the
time of history. A strong wind blew, the sun became brighter
and  the water parted. Gulf water stood like mountains to make a
dry path through the sea. Prophet Musa and Harun (pbut) guided the people
to cross the water. They were running to cross the water, when
they saw the Pharaoh and his army were coming from the back. Pharaoh and his army were amazed to see the
miracle. However, Pharaoh was still arrogant and wanted
to catch them. To encourage his army to told them,
Pharaoh: ""Look! The sea has opened at my command so that I
may follow those rebels and arrest them!"" They rushed across the divided water and when
they were midway, Allah (swt) ordered the sea to return to its original form. Pharaoh realized his mistake. When he saw there was no hope for his life. He declared,
Pharaoh: “I believe that there is no God except whom the Bani Israel believe, and I
am a Muslim."" But Allah (swt) did not accept his declaration. So the water closed over him and his entire
army and killed every one of them. The big waves threw his dead body to the western
Gulf shore. Allah (swt) saved Pharaoh's dead body to give
lesson to all the people, including you and me. Animal: May Allah (swt) save us from Arrogant
and give knowledge for right path. Yusuf: Ameen. Allah (swt)'s Mercy and kindness saved the
children of Israel from the evil Pharaoh. But after being slaves for many years they
were spoiled and ungrateful. On their journey, they saw a group of people
doing idol worshipping. Bani Israel requested prophet Musa (pbuh),
Man: ""O Musa, make a god for us like their gods."" So, they could worship that idol because they
left all of their idols back home in Egypt. Prophet Musa became sad for their request. He tried to convince them not to do idol worshipping
because only Allah (swt) is our creator and only God. We should only worship Allah (swt). He reminded them how Allah saved them from
the Pharaoh who killed their sons and let their daughters to live. They needed true guidance for their life. As Allah (swt)’s plan, they started their
long journey to the Mount Sinai. Another name is Tur Sinai. It’s also called Jabaal Musa or Gabal Musa. On the way, they needed water because the
land was very dry. So Allah (swt) commanded prophet Musa (pbuh)
to strike a rock with his stick. Suddenly twelve water fountains came out from
that rock. Each of the twelve different tribes of Bani
Israel got their own water. Ibn Abbas (R) said it was a special rock,
which they could carry from place to place. But Allah (swt) knows best. It was a very hot dry desert area for a walk. So Allah (swt) send clouds during the daytime
to protect them from the sun. After finishing all of their supplies, when
they needed food, Allah (swt) sent a special food for them called Manna and Salwa. The Manna was a type of grain. It was very white and very sweet. Before sunrise, it was spread throughout the
land. The children of Israel were only allowed to
collect as much as they could eat just for one day. They could not save for next day, so Allah
(swt) sent this special food at every morning. And Salwa was a small kind of bird, like Quail. They could catch those birds easily and eat
them however way they liked it. Animal: So, could they cook those birds? Yusuf: Yes, they could. Musa (pbuh) told them to eat the blessed food,
be thankful, and worship the one and only God Allah (swt). The children of Israel were a very lucky nation. Allah (swt) gave them such special gifts that
he did not give to any other nation. After a long journey, finally they arrived
on the east side of Mount Sinai. Allah (swt) told Musa (pbuh) to go to the
same place where he talked with Allah (swt) for the first time. At that place, he had to stay and fast for
30 days. Before he left, he requested his brother prophet
Harun (pbuh) to guide those Bani Israel. After thirty days of fasting and praying,
Allah (swt) added ten more days to continue his prayer and fasting. Total he spent 40 days for fasting and praying,
then he requested Allah (swt) that he wanted to see him. Allah (swt) inform prophet Musa (pbuh) that
he did not have the ability to see him. Then Allah (swt) told him to see some of the
nearest mountains. When Allah (swt) showed a very tiny light
of him to the mountains, the mountains were destroyed and turned into dust. Prophet Musa (pbuh) became senseless. Animal: So, that dust used as surmah or Kohl
for our eyes? Yusuf: No, that dust is not surmah. The sources of Surmah or Kohl is some kind
of black ithmid stone. Surmah or kohl is the oldest eye cosmetic. Even ancient Egyptian used this kind of eye
cosmetic. As you know using, surmah or kohl is Sunnah
of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). Now let's come to the story. After some time when he got his sense back,
he prayed and asked forgiveness from Allah (swt). He reminded prophet Musa (pbuh) that he was
kind enough to choose him as a prophet and he gave him very special gift, which was talking
with Allah (swt) directly. Allah (swt) told him to be grateful for whatever
he got. Then he gave prophet Musa (pbuh) some written
instructions on stone to guide his people. It was part of the holy book Torah, the famous
Ten Commandments. On the other side, during his 40 days of absence
very bad things happened to his people. They decided not to carry their stolen gold
any more, which they had steal from Egyptians before they left Egypt. So everybody put their stolen gold in one
place to burn. With them, they had an evil man named Samiri. He was good idol maker. With that gold, he made a beautiful and special
golden cow. During his work, he did some magical actions
to impress the people. There was a hole in that golden cow. So when the wind passing through, it produced
a sound. Samiri convinced the children of Israel that,
the golden cow was a living god and that god was making sounds. Some people forgot Allah (swt) and his prophet
Musa (pbuh). They instantly accepted the golden cow as
their god. Prophet Harun (pbuh) tried to convince them
not to worship that golden cow. At that point, all the people were divided
into three groups. One group had faith in Allah (swt) and his
prophets. Another group accepted the golden cow as their
god. And there was another group who were confused. Prophet Harun (pbuh) tried his best to bring
everyone in right path. Some of the ignorant people even threaten
to kill him. After 30 days, when prophet Musa did not comeback
from the mountain, people were asking prophet Harun (pbuh) about his brother. They even stated to think that might be Prophet
Musa (pbuh) died in the Mountain. So golden cow was their only hope. Animal: They decided to worship a cow idol
as their God! Animal2: When the Ten Commandments revealed? Yusuf: It was the same time when he was in
Mount Sinai for forty days and got the written holy stone plates. Animal: In the Quran, is there any verse close
to Ten Commandments? Yusuf: Some scholars says that surah Al Anam
verse 151 and 152 include the Ten Commandments of the Torah or the Old Testament. Now let's come to the story. After getting the Ten Commandments, when prophet
Musa (pbuh) was ready to come to his people, Allah (swt) informed him about the golden
cow and his people. When he heard they rejected Allah (swt) and
accepted a golden cow as their god, he became very sad and angry. He immediately came to his people. With anger he threw down Allah (swt)'s written
tablets. He saw his brother prophet Harun (pbuh), he
lost his temper, hold his hair and beard, and started to drag him to the crowd. Prophet Harun (pbuh) said he tried his best
to unite them together and waited for prophet Musa to bring a new guide for them. When he realized it was not his brother fault,
he requested forgiveness from his brother and Allah (swt). Then he asked Samiri about the golden cow. Samiri tried to convince that, he used a special
dust to make that cow holy. Animal: What kind of special dust did he use? Yusuf: Some scholar say that the dust came
from prophet Musa's feet. Other says, it was from the horse feet of
Jibrail (as). And some scholars believe it was just a lie
to convince prophet Musa (pbuh). But Allah (swt) knows best. Hearing his lame excuse, prophet Musa cursed
him. From that day, no one could come near to him
and touch him. He always shouted to the people until his
death, Man: ""Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Don't touch me!"" Prophet Musa (pbuh) broke and burned the golden
cow into pieces. Then threw them into the river. When he calmed himself down, he picked up
the written tablets because there was a guideline for Bani Israel. Worshiping any idol is a horrible crime. To get the pardon from Allah (swt) for their
crime, he chose 70 leaders from Bani Israel and took them to Mount Sinai. They requested Prophet Musa (pbuh) to hear
Allah (swt)'s voice. Allah accepted their request. A big cloud came and covered them. When Allah (swt) talked prophet Musa (pbuh),
they heard Allah (swt)'s voice. When the cloud removed some of them demanded
to see Allah (swt). Otherwise, they would not believe in him. Their ignorant demand made Allah (swt) very
angry. Suddenly a thunder came and electricity from
that thunder killed them instantly. Prophet Musa (pbuh) was helpless. He did not know what to do. He requested Allah (swt) not to kill them
because they were good people among Bani Israel. If he returned to his people like that, no
one would believe him. Allah (swt) accepted his request. All 70 elite people got their life back. All asked forgiveness from Allah (swt) for
their sins. Allah (swt) revealed a very hard law for the
Bani Israel. Prophet Musa came to his people and told them
to kill each other. To get Allah (swt)'s pardon everyone had to
follow his order. That was a horrible moment for Bani Israel. They started to kill their own people, fathers
killed their sons, sons killed their fathers, and brothers killed their brothers. Animal: Why did Allah (swt) give such an order? Yusuf: Because they were very ungrateful. Every single moment they were rejecting Allah
(swt) and his prophets. They crossed the limit by accepting the golden
cow as their God when they were still receiving Allah (swt)'s blessed food Mann and Salwa,
miracle water in that dry land and shelter by the cloud. When prophet Musa and Harun (pbut) saw that
horrible moment, they raised their hand to Allah (swt) to forgive the Bani Israel; otherwise,
the nation of Bani Israel would be destroyed. Allah (swt) accepted their prayer. To stop the killing, suddenly everything became
dark. Prophet Musa (pbuh) announced good news to
his people, Allah (swt)'s forgave everyone’s sins. Altogether 70 thousand Many people were killed
in that incident. After that, Prophet Musa and Haroun (pbuh)
started their journey to north for their Promised Land, Palestine. On the journey, Prophet Musa (pbuh) tried
to teach them Allah (swt)'s law which he got at Mount Sinai. But they were very lazy to follow the laws. They felt the laws were very hard to follow. Finally, they rejected the law. Man: ""We hear you but we cannot obey you."" One more time they made Allah (swt) very upset. He lifted one mountain over them to kill all. They became very afraid. Immediately everybody prostrated to Allah
(swt) and asked pardon. When all promised to obey the laws, Allah
(swt) saved them. After one year of journey from Egypt, they
reached the area of Pharan. In one place Prophet Musa (pbuh) chose 12
leaders from 12 tribes of the Bani Israel and send them to Palestine to get information
about that place. Animal: How the Boni Israel had 12 tribes? Yusuf: Prophet Israel or Yaqub (pbuh) had
12 sons. Later each son had his own tribes. 12 leaders started their journey to Palestine. They saw the people of Palestine were very
strong and big. Ten leaders became scared but two leaders
were very brave. One brave leader name was prophet Yusha (pbuh). His English name was Joshua. When the people of Bani Israel heard the news
about strong Palestinians, they refused to go there and fight with them. Prophet Musa told them it was their gifted
land by Allah (swt). So it would be very easy for them to win. Two of the brave leaders also tried to convince
them to attack the Palestinians. But the Bani Israel were coward. They refuse to fight with Palestine. They even told prophet Musa (pbuh),
Man: ""If the enemy doesn't leave the town we will not go there. You and your Lord fight with them, and we
will be sitting right here."" That made prophet Musa (pbuh) very angry. He cursed his people for their disobedience. So Allah (swt) punished them by not giving
them their promised land for forty years. They could not find the way to Palestine. Animal: They missed their opportunity. Yusuf: Yes, Allah (swt) gave them many opportunities
for a beautiful life. But always they brought bad luck on themselves
by rejecting Allah (swt)'s order. They were wandering from place to place (Map). Their hard life started for a long forty years. Animal: So, Allah (swt) stopped sending the
food Manna and Salwa? Yusuf: No, Allah (swt) is very kind and merciful. He did not stop sending the miracle food for
them. But after some time they requested prophet
Musa (pbuh) to arrange different kinds of food, like they were used to in Egypt. Prophet Musa (pbuh) was surprise and sad to
hear that. Then he told them to go to any town to get
that kind of food. Some scholars say, they started to live in
place of Eilat or Eila next to the north side of Aqaba Golf. Around that time, there was a pious man. He was very poor and honest. He always depended on Allah (swt). During the time of his death, he requested
Allah (swt) to take care his wife, his only son, his home and a baby cow. Surprisingly, he asked his wife:
Man: Take out baby cow to the forest and leave it there. Because I do not trust my people. They are selfish and greedy. After few years when the boy had grown up,
his mother told him: Women: Your father has left you a baby cow
in the trust of Allah (swt). It must have grown into a cow by now. The son was surprised and asked:
Son: Where is it? She advised him to be like his father. Trust in Allah (swt) then go to look for it. With a rope, he went to the forest and prostrated
to Allah (swt). When he raised his head, he saw a beautiful
yellow cow was coming towards him. He was very happy and took the cow with him. No one could come near it except the young
man and his mom. He used to sell wood for his living. During that time, a wealthy man died who did
not have any children, only a bad nephew. To get his uncle's property quickly he killed
his uncle. Then dropped his dead body in front of someone's
door and tried to blame for his uncle death. Two group blamed each other and was ready
to fight. Finally, they decided to go to prophet Musa
(pbuh) to solve the problem. Musa (pbuh) told Allah (swt)'s order to sacrifice
a cow then touched that dead body with a piece of meat of that cow. The dead man would get back in life and tell
the killer name. Everyone laughed when they heard this. Animal: Why did Allah (swt) chose a cow to
solve the problem? Yusuf: To test them, because in their heart
they still believed that cow was a god. So Allah (swt) knew it would not be easy for
them to kill a cow to solve their problem. In that point if they just sacrificed any
cow, problem would be solved easily. But they made that complicated. So Allah (swt) made it even more complicated
for them. They tried to ask prophet Musa (pbuh) too
much questions about the type of cow they should slaughter. They said,
Man: Ask your lord to tell us clearly about the cow. Prophet Musa (pbuh) told them it would be
not too old nor too young. That answer could not satisfy them. Man: Ask your lord to tell us about the color
of that cow. Prophet Musa (pbuh) told them it had to be
pleasant and bright yellow cow. They even make it more complicated. Man: Call your lord to make clear about the
cow. Because all cows look same to us. Allah (swt) told them such a cow that it was
hard to find. That cow never used in any kind of farming
but it was very healthy and fault free cow. Finally, they found that matched only with
the cow of that orphan boy. They wanted to buy that cow. But the boy and his mom did not want to sell
their cow. Finally, they agreed and asked for the same
weight of gold as the cow was. Boni Israel did not have any choice. So they bought that cow but their heart did
not allow them to sacrifice that beautiful yellow cow. Finally, they followed Allah (swt)'s order. The dead man waked up and told his killer
name. Prophet Musa (pbuh) ordered the crowd to kill
that killer. Animal_1: From now on, I will not asked too
much question to complicate the situation. Yusuf: Mashallah. That is the lesson from this story. Animal 2: If my parents say somethings to
do, I will do right away. I will not asked any question to my parents. Inshallah. Inshallah, I will tell you another very good
story. Some scholars say, the location of that story
was in the town of Eilat or Eila, which was next to north side of Aqaba Golf shore. Allah (swt) chose Friday for their worship
day but children of Israel chose Saturday for their day of worship. Worship day mean their holy day. At that day, they were not allowed to do any
kind of work even hunting or fishing from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset. It was called Sabbath. To test their heart, Allah (swt) used to send
lots and lots of fishes to the shore on Saturday. The fishes played on the shore openly. But other days, fishes did not come to the
shore. So it was very hard to catch fish for them. After sometimes, one of the Bani Israel figured
out an evil plan to catch that fish. On Friday, he dug a hole in the shore. He put some tree branches in it and cover
some part of the hole with a net. It was a trap for the fish. On Saturday, some of the fish fell into the
trap. On Sunday, he collected fishes from that trap. To follow him day-by-day more people started
to use that kind of trap for the fish. When good people asked them, why were they
breaking Sabbath or Saturday law? They reply to them,
Man: “We don't catch fish on Saturday, on Sunday we catch fish."" All people divided in three groups. One was good group; they did not catch fish. They also told others not to catch fish because
their evil act might bring punishment to Bani Israel. Another group was an evil group they openly
broke the law. And the 3rd group was, they did not catch
fish but did not told others not to break Allah (swt)'s law. Prophet Musa (pbuh) warned them about Allah
(swt)'s punishment. One day, he told good people to get out from
the town, stay outside of the town wall, and close the town gates. Next day when good people woke up, they did
not hear any noise from inside the town. They climb the wall and surprised to see the
bad people’s condition. Because everyone became a monkey with a tail. It was a horrible moment for everyone. Some scholars say, they became monkeys for
three days then everyone died after that. But Allah (swt) knows best. Animal: Astaqfirullah, I will not use any
trick to follow Allah (swt)’s law. Animal: Most of the Children of Bani Israel
did not follow prophet Musa (as) order! Yusuf: Yes, they always gave him a hard time. They even spread a scandal about prophet Musa
(pbuh). He always used to dress long clothing to cover
his full body. People never saw him without his clothes. So some of the evil men spread that prophet
Musa (pbuh) had very bad skin disease. They even spread rumors about his private
parts. So Allah (swt) made a plan. One-day prophet Musa (pbuh) was taking bath
behind a rock. He put all his clothes on top of the rock. After finished his bath, he tried to take
his clothes but the miracle happened. The rock started to run with his clothes! He started to run to get his clothes back. Finally, the rock took him into a crowd area,
where many Bani Israel saw him in that condition. They saw him as a perfect man. Then he quickly took his clothes and hit that
rock with his stick. In this way, Allah (swt) saved him from the
evil rumors. Animal: Did he have any kids? Yusuf: From the Quran and hadith, we cannot
confirm about his children. Some historian say prophet musa had two sons
but Allah (swt) knows the best. When their 40 years were almost finished,
most of the Bani Israel, who came from Egypt, died. Their children became grown up. Finally, Allah (swt) gave permission to start
their journey to their promise land. At that time, Prophet Musa and Harun (pbut)
became very old. After many years of preaching to the people,
prophet Harun (pbuh) died at the age of 119 in that journey near Mount Hor before reach
to the promise land, Palestine. Some scholars believe that he was buried on
the top of the Mount Hor but Allah (swt) knows best. After losing his brother, Prophet Musa (pbuh)
took his people and took full control of the Moab Area. Then the merciful Allah (swt) gave them a
chance to forgive their sins. He ordered prophet Musa (pbuh) to enter with
his people to a beautiful city. Some scholars say, that city might be Shittim,
which was on the eastern site of the Jordan, opposite to Jericho. Allah (swt) told them to go to that city and
enjoy different kinds of food from there. When they entered the city, they should lower
their heads, ask forgiveness from Allah (swt), and say ‘Hittatun, Hittatun’. They also had to be very kind, gentle and
grateful to their lord, Allah (swt). Do you know what Bani Israel did? Animal: What? Did they make a mistake again? Yusuf: Yes, they did as usual. Bani Israel again made a mistake. They entered the city with pride and did not
lower their heads. They did not say Hittatun, Hittatun. They changed the word to ‘Habbatun, Habbatun. They were not kind and gentle at all. This time Allah (swt) punished them with disease
that was like a plague. Almost 14 thousand people died for that punishment. Around two years after Harun (pbuh) died,
Allah (swt) sent the Angel of Death to Prophet Musa (pbuh) to take his life. When Prophet Musa (pbuh) saw the Angel of
Death, he slapped him on the eye. The Angel returned to his Lord and said that
prophet Musa (pbuh) did not want to die. As a respect, Allah (swt) offered him to put
his hand on the back of an Ox and for every hair that would come into his hand, Allah
(swt) would grant him that many years of life for him. Prophet Musa said, what would happen after
that? Allah (swt) replied he had to die after that. He did not want to extend his life. Welcome the death to him, and request Allah
(swt) to take his life close to the promise Land. The merciful Allah accepted his last request. He died at the age of 123 years, close to
the holy land at Mount Nebo. His grave is below a red sand hill close to
Palestine. This is the end of our great prophet Musa
(pbuh) story. Inshallah, next time we will enjoy another
beautiful story of the prophets."
"Assalamualikum, Inshallah today we will learn
about Prophet Ibrahim (pbuh). Are you ready? Let’s get started. Prophet Ibrahim (pbuh) was the 10th generation
after Noah (pbuh) and he was born in Babylon. His father did not believe in Allah (T) at
all and he used to make the idols with his own hands. Allah (T) protected prophet Ibrahim's heart
and mind from the evil and gave him wisdom ever since he was a child. At the age of seven, he asked his father about
a funny looking idol with big ears. His father answered:
""It is Mardukh, the god of gods, son! These big ears show his deep knowledge."" This made Ibrahim laugh. Time went by, and Ibrahim became a young man
with full of hatred for those idols. As a child when he used to go to temple with
his father, he was surprised to see the behavior of the people with the idols as if the idols
could hear or understand them. At first, it was funny to him, but later he
began to feel angry to his people for their foolishness. He thought God is greater than those useless
idols. Animal: How did prophet Ibrahim know about
Allah (T) existed? Yusuf: Oh the story behind that is interesting
to hear about. One night Abraham left his house to go to
a mountain. He was thinking about the sky, stars and moon
which some people accepted them as their gods. But his heart said how come they could be
God. Sometimes we could see them and sometimes
we could not see them. He was continuing search for god. One day Allah (T) guided him to the Truth. He felt good to realized that, only Allah
(T) is our one and only true God. A new life started for Ibrahim (pbuh). His only mission was to call his people to
the Truth. He invited his father to Islam but his father
became very angry with him and warned him to stop otherwise he would stone him as a
punishment. Like his father, other people also rejected
his call and threatened him. Animal: Wow, they were very bad. Animal2: Then what did he do? Did he make plans to make them learn that
Allah (swt) really existed? Yusuf: Yes. Then he made a plan to destroy their idols. During one big festival when everybody was
on the riverbank, he went the temple with an ax and destroyed all the statues except
for the biggest one. Before he left the temple he hung the ax around
its neck and left. When the people returned, they were shocked
to see their gods smashed to pieces, lying scattered all over the temple. They began to guess who had done that to their
idols and Prophet Ibrahim's name came to their minds. They brought him to the temple and asked him:
""Are you the one who has done this to our gods?"" He told them to ask the biggest idol which
was unbroken. They said to him,
""You know well that these idols don't speak!"" He asked them, then why they worship those
idols, who neither speak nor see nor even can defend for themselves. They realized that they were wrong but their
arrogance would not allow them to admit their foolishness. They started yelling at him and shouting:
""Burn him! Burn him!"" Animal: What?!! Did they really want to burn him? Animal2: With a huge fire? Animal: Then he will die! Are you sure they wanted to kill him for that? Yusuf: Yes, but Allah (T) had a different
plan. They didn’t want to listen to prophet Ibrahim’s
advice. So,
They kept him in chains and planned their revenge. Anger was burning in their hearts. They decided to throw Ibrahim (pbuh) into
the biggest fire they could build. They dug a deep hole, filled it with firewood
and made a huge fire. The people stood away from the fire because
of the great heat. They put Prophet Ibrahim (pbuh) on the catapult,
his hands and feet were tied. They were ready to throw him into this big
fire. And right at that time the angel Gibriel came
near his head and asked him: ""O Ibrahim do you wish for anything?"" Animal: Did Prophet Ibrahim (as) asked to
be saved from the fire? Yusuf: No, he said: he only wish that Allah
would be pleased with him. The catapult was released, and Ibrahim (pbuh)
was thrown in the fire. But Allah would not allow His Prophet to be
killed, He ordered the fire: to be cool and safe for Prophet Ibrahim (pbuh)! Then miracle happened. The fire obeyed Allah (T)'s order. Prophet Ibrahim (pbuh) came out from the fire
as if he was coming out from a peaceful garden. His face was bright. There was no sign of smoke on his clothes. People were shocked to see that and said:
""Amazing! Ibrahim’s God has saved him from the fire!"" Yusuf: This story has two lessons. Who can tell me? Animal: I know, I know. Allah (T) tested to see how strong faith prophet
Ibrahim (As) had about him. Animal2: I know the second one. Allah (T) showed his miracle to tell others
that Ibrahim (pbuh) was really prophet, so people would believe in him and accept his
words. Yusuf: That’s right. MashAllah. After that, when the king of Babylon, Namrud,
heard about this event he became very angry. He wanted to debate with him and show his
people that he, the king is indeed the god, and Ibrahim was a liar. He asked Ibrahim:
""What can your god do that I can’t?"" Prophet Ibrahim (pbuh) said, Allah (T) gives
life and death. King said proudly,
""I give life and death. I can kill anyone, bring them from the street
and I can give my pardon to a person who was sentenced to death and save his life."" Prophet Ibrahim (pbuh) said, Allah (T) makes
the sun rise from the East. Can you make it rise from the West? Namrud was speechless. Animal: He was very smart and brave. Yusuf: Yes he was. After long time calling people to worship
the one and only God, Allah (T), only one woman and one man believed in him. The woman's name was Sarah and she became
his wife. The man's was his nephew, Lot (pbuh) and he
became a prophet. So they decided to move out from Babylon. Ibrahim, Lot and Sarah (pbut) started their
long travel. They crossed Syria, Palestine then Egypt calling
people to one and only God, Allah (T), helping the poor and doing good deeds. By that time prophet Lot (pbuh) migrated close
to the Dead Sea, the city of gay people. One day Ibrahim (pbuh) begged Allah (T) to
show him how the dead people will come back to life on the Day of Judgment. Allah commanded Ibrahim (pbuh) to take four
birds, cut them up and mix their body parts, divide them into four portions and place them
on top of four different hills, then call back the birds in Allah's name. Immediately the mixed parts of the birds separated
to join their original bodies in different places and the birds flew back to Ibrahim
(pbuh). Animal: Wow, what a beautiful miracle Allah
(T) showed him. Animal_2: What happened in Egypt? In Egypt there was a very bad king. He tried to harm the prophet wife Sarah (pbuh). When he saw her, he tried to hold her with
his hand but his hand got stiff. He asked Sarah:
""Pray to your Lord for me and I shall not harm you."" After Allah (T) cure him, he again tried to
hold her. His hand stiffed again. Then he realize, she was not an ordinary women. He again request to Sarah (pbuh) to cure him. Allah (T) cure him again. Before Sarah left that place, as a gift, the
king gave her an Egyptian maid servant, named Hajar (pbuh). Animal: Hajar? She was the prophet’s second wife, right? Animal2: And she was the mother of Prophet
Ismail (pbuh), right? Yusuf: Yes, Mash Allah. You know the story. Animal: When did she became Prophet Ibrahim’s
second wife? Time went by and no children were born to
Sarah. But they were getting old. So Sarah requested prophet Ibrahim (pbuh)
to marry her servant Hajar (pbuh) and prayed Allah (T) to bless them with a child. Hajar gave birth a son, named Ismail (pbuh)
but at that time Ibrahim (pbuh) was an old man. Animal: Oh, now I know. Yusuf: Now I will tell you the story of Zamzam. As Allah (T)’s plan, one day, Ibrahim (pbuh)
woke up and asked his wife Hajar to get her son and prepare for a long journey. At that time Ismail (pbuh) was a little cute
baby. After a long, long walk, they reached one
desert place next to As-Safa and Al Marwa Mountain. That valley had no fruit, no trees and no
water. The valley had no sign of life. As Allah (T)'s plan, Ibrahim (pbuh) left them
alone with a small amount of food and water which was hardly enough for 2 days. Hajar (pbuh) asked him why he was leaving
them in this desert area. Abraham did not answer her. She asked him, did Allah (T) command him to
do so?"" Prophet replied: ""Yes."" Then his great wife realized that, they were
not alone, Allah (T) would be with them. Hajar went on nursing Ismail and drinking
from the water until it was finished. She became very thirsty and the child was
crying. She left him on the al-Marwa hill and hurried
to the nearest hill, as-Safa. She stood there and started looking at the
valley so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She was running back to the al-Marwa hill. She stood and started looking but could see
nobody. She kept running between as-Safa and al-Marwa
seven times. When she reached al-Marwa for the last time,
she was very tired, she sat next to the baby. Then she heard a voice. She stood up and asked help. She saw an angel digging the earth until water
flowed! She built a little basin around it. She scooped water with her hands, drank, filled
her water-skin, and nursed her baby. The place from which water flowed was Zamzam. Animal: What a miracle! Animal2: But, they lived there alone. They must have been scared. Animal: They even need food to survive and
they barely had any. Yusuf: Yes, Allah (T) had a really big plan. He was very pleased on Hajar (pbuh) for her
strong faith in Allah (T). So he sent some Arab travelers through Makkah. They saw birds flying around Al-Marwa. ""They must be flying around water."" When they arrived at the water, they found
Hajar and asked her: ""Would you allow us to stay with you, and
use this water?"" She agreed and became very happy to see new
people. The people settled there and became permanent
residents. The whole valley became alive. Animal: When Prophet Ibrahim sacrificed his
son Ismail? When Ismail (pbuh) was a little boy. One night Ibrahim (pbuh) saw a dream to sacrifice
his son Ismail. The next night Allah (T) showed him the same
dream. He became ready to fullfill Allah (T)'s order
even though he loved his son dearly. Ibrahim (pbuh) came to Ismail (pbuh) and told
him about the dream. He asked his son’s opinion. Ismail (pbuh) advised his father to fulfill
Allah (T)'s order and he would show his patience. On the way, Ibrahim (pbuh) took a knife and
passed a place called Mina. The devil, Shaytan, came to them and tried
to convince them not to fulfill Allah (T)'s order. They both chased shaytan away, turned their
back on him and did not listen. When they reached Mount Arafat, Prophet Ibrahim
had laid his son Ismail (pbuh) on his forehead while he was on the ground. He then took the knife and was ready to sacrifice
his son. At that moment Allah (T) called out to him
""O Abraham! You have fulfilled the vision!"" Then Allah (T) ordered his beloved prophet
Ibrahim (pbuh) to sacrifice an animal instead of his son Ismail (pbuh). Animal: That’s why that little boy Ismail
(pbuh) became a prophet. He had very strong faith on Allah (T) ever
since he was a child. Animal2: I wish I had a strong faith like
him. Yusuf: Mashallah. We should pray all the time for our strong
faith about Allah (T). That’s the only way we will be successful
in this life and the hereafter. Animal: So, when was Prophet Ishaq (pbuh)
born? When Ibrahim and Sarah (pbut) was very old,
the angels came to see them in a human form. The prophet welcome them as a stranger and
guest. He served them a roasted calf but they did
not eat any food. Prophet Ibrahim started to fear. The guest informed him not to fear because
they were the angels. They brought good news for them. They said Allah (T) was going to give them
a son. That son was to be called Ishaq and he was
to be a prophet. Sarah could not believe it was true. She was very old. The angels said that all things are possible
to Allah (T). Animal: Did prophet Ibrahim visit to prophet
Ismail? Yusuf: Yes. Ismail grew up, learned Arabic, and later
got married. After a while, prophet Ibrahim (pbuh) came
to see his family. But by this time his wife Hajar (pbuh) had
died and her son Ismail (pbuh) was not at home. So the prophet asked Ismail's wife about their
living condition. But she complained him about everything. She was not grateful about Allah (T)'s blessing. Prophet Ibrahim realized that she was very
ungrateful. This kind of women would not be a good wife
for a prophet, Ismail (pbuh). He left secret message for his son to divorce
her. Ismail (pbuh) obeyed his father. He divorce his wife and married another woman. After a while Ibrahim (pbuh) again visited
his son and see he married a very good woman. She was very grateful to Allah (T)'s blessing. Animal: When was the Kaaba build? Yusuf: Now, the time arrived to build Ka’ba. Allah (T) order Prophet Ibrahim (pbuh) to
build a house to worship him. He went his son prophet Ismail (pbuh) to get
his help to build the Ka’ba. Then they raised the foundations of the Ka’ba. The foundation stone for the Ka’ba came
from the heaven. It is found today in a corner of the Ka’ba
and is known as the black stone. Ismail (pbuh) brought stones while Ibrahim
(pbuh) built the wall and when the walls became high, Ismail brought a stone and put it for
his father who stood over it. This stone called Makam Ibrahim. Finally they finished the building. Then they both pray to their lord to accept
their service. Animal: How long did Prophet Ibrahim (pbuh)
live? Animal2: And where is his grave? The Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) lived
for around 175 years. His life was full of happenings, tests and
trials. He had a firm faith in Allah (T). When he passed away, he was buried in Hebron,
twenty miles south-west of Jerusalem. This is the end of our story for today, Inshallah,
next time we will enjoy another beautiful story of the prophets."
"Animals: Assalamu Alaikum. Yusuf: Walaikum Assalam. How are you children? Animals: Alhamdulillah, we are fine. We like to hear prophet stories from you. Yusuf: Ok, Mashallah. That's very good. The stories of the prophet are important for
all Muslims. Insallah, today we will learn about the story
of Prophet Yusha (pbuh). Are you ready for that? Animals: Yessssss. Yusuf: Ok, let start. Bismillah. Prophet Yusha, English name is Joshua (pbuh). His father name is Nun, grandfather is Ephraim
and great grandfather is Prophet Yusuf (pbuh). He was a servant and student of Prophet Musa
(pbuh). He joined with Prophet Musa to meet Khidr
(pbut). When Musa (pbuh) chose 12 leaders from the
Boni Israel or children of Israel to send Palestine to get information about that place,
Prophet Yusha was one of them. After 40 days all 12 leaders return from Palestine
and tell about the Palestinian who were very big and strong. So all Boni Israel ware scared to attack Palestine. They denied prophet Musa (pbuh)’s order. They even thinking to go back Egypt. In that situation Prophet Yusha and his friend
Caleb encourage the Boni Israel to have faith on Allah (swt). Inshallah, they would be winner if they became
brave to fight with that strong Palestinian and enter the town through the gate. Some of Boni Israel threated to prophet Yusha
(pbuh): Man: We will kill you by stone! Animal: Why they wanted to fight with Palestinian? Were they bad people? Yusuf: Palestine is a holy land. This is the land of many prophets. During the drought when prophet Israel (pbuh)
and his children had to move to Egypt, some non-believers immigrant took control the Palestine. Some historian say they were not Arab, came
from Europe but Allah (swt) knows best. They were very bad, tall, strong people. Allah (swt) did not wanted that holly land
control by evil people. So he guided his prophets to take over that
holly land and he would help them to win that city. But children of Israel became coward. So Allah (swt) became angry on them but he
was very happy on prophet Yusha and Caleb (pbut). Allah (swt) declared no adult from Boni Israel
could go to Palestine. Only Prophet Yusha and Caleb could go that
holy land. After prophet Musa (pbuh)’s death, he selected
his army with new energetic generation. He did not joined anyone who was newly married. If someone build new home to live, he also
could not join the army. If someone bought pregnant farm animal and
waiting to give birth, he also rejected from that army. At Friday prophet Yusha (pbuh) took his army
and attacked Jericho the first city of Palestine. It was a very big fight. At evening prophet Yusha (pbuh) started to
worry. As Allah (swt)’s law they were not allowed
to fight after sunset because Saturday would start. As you know Saturday was the day of Sabbath. It was prayer day or holly day for them. So he request Allah (swt) to stop the sun. Allah (swt) accepted his request and hold
the sun from setting until their victory. Animal: Sun really stopped for prophet Yusha
(as)? Yusuf: In one hadith Prophet Mohammad (s)
said, the sun never stopped for any man only for Yusha (pbuh). It was a great victory for Boni Israel. After the victory, they gathered all the valuable
items they found from the enemies and put it one place. The items called the spoils of war. Before prophet Mohammed (swt) it was Allah
(swt)’s law, on one could use that kind of items. One miracle fire came to destroy that items
but it was waiting for something. Prophet Yusha realized that some people hide
some valuable items from their enemies. So he called one man from each tribe and put
their hand together. The hand of one man stuck to his hand. Prophet said, the evil people were in his
tribe. He called all man from that tribe and put
their hand with him. Two or three hand stuck to his hand. Because they were the guilty persons. They collected one bowl of gold which were
equal to a head of cow. Prophet Yusha order them to bring back their
stolen gold and put on the place where everybody put. One miracle fire came and all the items were
disappeared. After Prophet Musa (pbuh) he guided children
of Israel for about twenty-eight years. At the age of 100 years prophet Yusha or Joshua
(pbuh) died in Palestine. He was buried in Palestine but location of
that grave is unknown. Some people claim, prophet Yusha’s grave
is on Yusha Hill, in Istanbul. But we did not find any evidence for that. Allah (swt) knows best."
"Yusuf: Assalamu Alaikum. Ok, Mashallah. That's very good. The stories of the prophet are important for
all Muslims. Insallah, today we will learn about the story
of Prophet Ismail(pbuh). Are you ready for that? Ok, let start. Bismillah. Yusuf: Today I will tell you about the story
of prophet Ismail (pbuh)’s in a shorter version. If you want to know the details, please see
our prophet Ibrahim (pbuh) story. Ibrahim (as) had been married to Sarah for
a while but they did not have any children. So she requested prophet Ibrahim (as) to marry,
her very religious housemaid, Hajar (pbuh). After their marriage they had a beautiful
baby boy and they named him Ismael. As Allah(T)’s plan, one day, Ibrahim (pbuh)
woke up and asked his wife Hajar (pbuh) to get their cute baby son, Ismail (pbuh) and
prepare themselves for a long journey. After a long, long walk, Prophet Ibrahim (pbuh)
dropped them between As-Safa and Al Marwa Mountain and left them alone. That desert valley did not had any water or
food. After their water was finished, both Hajar
and Ismail (pbut) became very thirsty. Hajar (pbuh) was running between As-Safa and
Al Marwa Mountain seven times to look for water. Finally Allah (T) sent an angel to discover
the great Zamzam well to fulfill their water needs. And send some Arab travelers so they were
not alone in that valley. Pretty soon the valley became alive with many
families and Allah's blessings. When Ismail (pbuh) became a boy, Allah (T)
ordered prophet Ibrahim (pbuh) in his dream to sacrifice his beloved only son. That was the biggest test on their faith for
Allah (T). But they both passed the test successfully. Allah (T) was happy for their sacrifice and
strong faith. Ismail (pbuh) grew up and spread Islam just
like his father far and wide. His first wife was not very grateful with
Allah (T), so with his father advised him to divorce her and married a very religious
women. When Allah (T) was very happy with Prophet
Ismail and his father Prophet Ibrahim (pbut), he ordered them to build the Ka'ba, the house
of Allah and to keep one special black stone on the eastern corner of the Kaaba. Prophet Ismail was in charge to take care
of Kaaba and teach others about the Hajj. He was very patient, good and righteous. Animal: I want to hear a story about how he
always kept his promises. Animal2: Yes me too. He always kept his promises. One day he promised one person to meet him
at the evening time at a particular place. As his promise he went there but that particular
person did not come. But prophet Ismail (pbuh) did not left the
place. When that person came at night and saw the
prophet was waiting for him, he was shocked and surprised. Animal: Wow, he was a very good promise keeper. Animal: From today I will keep my promises
too, insallah. Yusuf: Masallah, That's great. He used to command his family and the people
to pray their prayers to Allah (T) and give charity. Prophet Ismail (pbuh) had many sons and daughters
who migrated to several parts of the Arabian peninsula and they spread the teachings of
Ibrahim (pbuh) wherever they settled. He often used to go to Palestine to visit
his father’s grave and see his brother Prophet Ishaq (pbuh). Some scholar say, the same year of his death,
one of his daughter and one of Prophet Ishaq’s son got married. He lived all of his life in Mekkah and passed
away and he was buried in the Mekkah next to his mother Hagar (pbuh). At that time his age was 136 years old. This is the end of our story for today, Inshallah,
next time we will enjoy another beautiful story of  the prophets."
"Prophet Adam (puh) Animals: Assalamu Alaikum. Yusuf: Walaikum Assalam. How are you children? Animals: Alhamdulillah, we are fine. We like to hear prophet stories from you. Yusuf: Ok, Mashallah. That's very good. The stories of the prophet are important for
all Muslims. Insallah, today we will learn about the story
of Prophet Adam (puh). Are you ready for that? Animals: Yessssss. Yusuf: Ok, let start. Bismillah. Long long ago, Allah (T) created the universe,
the sun, the moon, and the earth. Then Allah (T) decided to create Human. So he sent the angels to collect clay from
this earth. The angels came to this earth and collected
clay from different places. Then Allah (T) made a shape of a man and called
him Adam (puh). Allah (T) kept this figure for 40 years. The angels and the Iblish were wondering,
what was that? They were scared but Iblish felt scared the
most. One day Allah (T) breath his spirit into Adam
(puh). When spirit reached his head Adam (puh) sneezed. When the spirit reached his eyes, he looked
at the fruits in Paradise. When it reached his stomach he felt hungry
and he wanted to eat the fruits. He jumped in a hurry before the spirit could
reach his legs, so Adam (puh) fell, and Allah said that man is impatient. Allah (T) then ordered all the angels and
Iblish to prostrate to Adam (puh) but this was to show respect to him not worship him. All of the angels were prostrating before
Adam except Iblish, he thought he was better than Adam because he created from fire and
Adam (puh) was created from clay. He even argue with Allah (T). From that moment Iblish became the Shaytan,
the evil. Allah had cursed Iblish until the Day of Judgement. Shaytan understood his future that Allah will
throw him in the Hell fire. So he requested a special power from Allah
(T) so he could mislead the humans and take them to the hell fire with him. Allah (T) accepted his last request and gave
him the special power. Allah (T) warned us if someone follow Shaytan,
he will throw them in the Hell fire with Iblish. Allah even gave us the Quran to teach us how
to stay safe from Shaytan. Animal: Why did Iblish want to mislead the
human? Yusuf: Hmm..., let's see, does anyone know? Who can tell me? Animal: I can tell. Because of a human he became Shaytan, the
evil. That made him very mad. So he wanted to harm the human and take them
to the hell fire with him. Yusuf: Masallah. That's right. He is the greatest enemy to all of us. Shaytan is the symbol of evil, the angels
are the symbol of good and humans, in this case Adam is the symbol of knowledge. Adam was really smart because Allah had taught
him all the names of everything. Animal: How was Eve, the mother of mankind
created? Yusuf: Well as the years went by Adam (puh)
was alone in paradise and he felt really lonely. One day he slept for some time and when he
woke up, he saw a woman whom Allah (T) created from his shortest left rib. Adam(puh) asked her,
(Adam): ""Who are you?"" (Eve): ""A woman""
(Adam): ""Why have you been created?"" (Eve): ""So that you could find peace in me."" The angels were trying to find out the knowledge
of Adam(puh), and so they asked him: (Angel): "" O Adam, What is her name?"" (Adam): ""Eve"". (Angel): ""Why is her name Eve?"" (Adam): "" Because she was created from something
living."" Yusuf: Adam and Eve (puh) were living happily
in paradise and Allah (T) gave them the permission to enjoy everything, everything except for
one tree. Allah (T) told them, Shaytan was their greatest
enemy, and he would want both of them out of the paradise. And they both understood that they were forbidden
to eat the fruits from that tree. Many years had gone by, and Adam was only
a human, and humans tends to forget. So Shaytan took Adam's weakness to his advantage. And day after day Shaytan whispered to Adam
and Eve (puh) to eat the forbidden fruits. One day they forgot the warning that Allah
gave and decided to eat the fruits from the forbidden tree. They picked one of the fruits. They had hardly finished eating when they
felt their heart pounding, as it filled with pain, sadness and shame. The surrounding atmosphere had changed and
the internal music had stopped. They discovered that they were naked. They both covered themselves with leaves. They were in big trouble after they disobeyed
Allah (T). Allah sent both of them out of paradise. Animal: When did they come to the earth? Yusuf: It was Friday when they set foot on
earth. Also do you know, it was Friday when Adam
(puh) was created as well? That's why the best day of sun rise is Friday. Animal: Where was the place they set foot
on earth? Yusuf: According to Ibn Umar (ra), Adam (puh)
came down on As-Safa mountain and Eve(puh) came down on Al-Marwa mountain. Adam knew he had to face conflict and struggle
on earth. He had to protect himself and his family with
clothes and weapons from the wild beasts, and above all, he had to struggle with the
spirit of evil. Their new life started in the earth. They started the family with a set of twins,
named Cain and his sister. Later they had another set of twins, Abel
and his sister. The family enjoyed the generous gift and fruits
of the earth provided by their Lord Allah (T). The children grew up to be strong and healthy
young adults. Cain was a farmer, who grew crops in his land,
while Abel was a shepherd who raised animals. When they are old enough to get married, Allah
(T) revealed to Adam (puh) that each son should marry their other twin sister. That's meant Abel should marry Cain's twin
sister and Cain should marry Abel's twin sister. But Cain refused Allah's command. He wanted to marry his own twin sister. Adam (puh) was in a difficulty. He wanted peace and harmony in his family,
so he prayed to Allah (T) for help. Allah (T) commanded that each son should offer
a sacrifice, and whose offering was accepted would have the right to marry in his choice. Both were ready to sacrifice. Able offered his very best animal but Cain
who was the trouble maker offered his worst grains. So, so far Cain already made two mistake. Who can tell me? Animal_1: He disobeyed Allah's (T) order,
because he didn't want to marry Abel's sister Animal_2: And second, he didn't do his sacrifice
properly. Yusuf: That's right. Do you think, Cain's sacrifice would be accepted
by Allah (T)? Animal: Noooooooo. Yusuf: That's right. Allah (T) did not accept Cain's sacrifice
because of his disobedience. This made Cain extremely angry. He realized that he didn't have any hope to
marry his own beautiful sister. His arrogance took him to the path of shaytan,
and Cain threatened to kill Abel. One Day, Abel was late returning from his
work. So Adam sent Cain to see what happened to
him. Cain got a chance to get his brother alone. Cain was so mad that he struck his brother
with a stone killing him instantly. Animal: sound. This was the first death and the first criminal
act committed by man on earth. Shaytan mislead the human one more time. That's how crime started in this earth. When Abel was missing for some time, Adam
began to search for him but could not find his beloved son. He asked Cain about Abel, but Cain said that,
Cain: I am not my brother keeper. After that Adam understood that Abel was dead,
and Adam was filled with great sadness. Animal: What did Cain do with his brother
dead body? Yusuf: Because Abel was the first dead person
on the earth, Cain didn't know what to do with it. He carried the body on his back wandering
from place to place trying to hide it. As a mercy, from Allah (T), he sent two ravens
that began fighting, causing the death of one bird. The victorious bird used its beak and claws
to dig a hole in the ground, rolled the dead raven into it and covered it with dirt. When Cain saw this he was ashamed of himself. Cain then buried his brother, which was also
the first burial of man. Adam (puh) was depressed by the loss of his
two sons. One was dead, the other was won over by Shaytan. He prayed for his sons and advised his other
children and grandchildren, telling them about Allah (T) and calling them to believe in Him. He told them about Shaytan and warned them
by his own experience. He reminded them how Shaytan tempted Cain
to kill his brother Abel. Years and years passed, Adam(puh) grew old
and he had many children on the earth. When Adam's death drew near, he appointed
his son Seth to be next guidance for human being. When Adam's (puh) death was near, he felt
an appetite for the fruits of Paradise, so his children tried searching for the fruits. While they were searching they met the Angels. The Angels told them to go back to Adam (puh)
because he was dying. So they returned with the Angels and when
Eve (puh) saw the Angel of death she recognized him, and ran to Adam. Adam (puh) knew his wife was scared but he
told her that this was the time for him to go, and it's all because of Allah's (T) will. Before his death, he told his children that
Allah (T) would not leave man alone on the earth but he would send prophets to guide
them. The prophets would have different names, traits
and miracles, but they would be united in one thing; to call to worship Allah (T) alone. Adam (puh) closed his eyes and the Angels
entered his room and surrounded him. When he recognized the Angel of Death among
them, his heart smiled peacefully. So they took his soul and wrapped it. They prayed for him and dug a grave and laid
him in it. This was the tradition at the time of death. This is the end of our story for today, Inshallah,
next time we will enjoy another beautiful story of the prophets. The source of Story
Stories Of The Prophets By Ibn Kathir"
"Yusuf: Assalamu Alaikum. Ok, Mashallah. That's very good. The  stories of the prophet are important for all
Muslims. Insallah, today we will learn about the story
of Prophet Yaqub(pbuh). Are you ready for that? Ok, let start. Bismillah. Prophet Ishaq (as) had twin sons, one was
Eish and other one was Yaqub (pbuh), also known as Jacob in English. Their grandfather, prophet Ibrahim saw them
before his death. Their father prophet Ishaq (pbuh) liked Yaqub
(as) more than Eish. So Eish were jealous of his twin brother Yaqub
(pbuh). His jealousy became stronger and stronger
as they grew older. When Allah (T) choose him as a prophet, Eish
became very jealous, he even threatened to kill his brother. Yaqub (pbuh) did not feel safe to stay with
his family, so he ran away from the house. When night came he found a place to rest. He took a stone and put it under his head
and slept. In his dream he saw a ladder from heaven to
earth. Angels were coming and going. In the dream Allah (T) gave good news to bless
him and his future generation with this land. He felt very happy when he woke up and promised
to Allah (T) that, if he returned to his family, he would build a mosque in this place and
give donation, one tenth of his property. He poured oil on the stone so later he could
recognize that place. Animal: Where is that place located? Yusuf: The location of that place was in Jerusalem. Many years had passed. Prophet Yaqub (pbuh) was away from his home. During that time he got married two times
and they werer both sisters. His younger wife had two sons, the oldest
was named Yusuf, also known as Joseph in English, and his younger brother was Binyamin, also
known as Benjamin in English. When his second wife got pregnant and gave
birth to her son Benjamin, she died after delivery at the place Efrat, 7 miles south
of Jerusalem. Prophet Yaqub’s second wife and her son
Yusuf (pbut) were most beautiful people on the earth. Allah (T) inspired Yaqub (pbuh) to return
to his father and his people. Prophet Yaqub (pbuh) decided to go back to
his father with his family. When Yaqub (pbuh) came close to his home,
the angels greeted him and told him that from that day his name would be Israel. Animal: So, he had three names? His Arabic name was Yaqub, English name was
Jacob and Angels gave him another name Israel? Animal: I thought Israel is a name of a place. Yusuf: Yes, the name Israel originally comes
from his name. The Qur’an mentions his people’s name
many times, like Boni Israel. Then he sent his greeting to his brother Eish
and requested him to be his brother and friend but Eish rode towards him with few hundred
men. Getting that news prophet Yaqub (pbuh) became
afraid and asked help from Allah (T) to stop evil of his brother. Then Yaqub (pbuh) prepared a great gift for
his brother with few hundred animals (goats, rams, camels, cows, donkeys) and sent it to
his brother. With Allah (T)’s blessing Eish mind was
changed. He ran to prophet Yaqub (pbuh), embraced and
kissed him. Finally the two brothers became friends. Animal: That was such a happy ending! Yusuf: Yes, with Allah (T)’s blessing it
was a happy ending between the two brothers. Yaqub (pbuh) introduced his family to his
brother. After that prophet Yaqub came to his father
prophet Ishaq (pbuh) and settled with him in the village of Hebron, where prophet Ibrahim
used to live. When Prophet Yaqub’s father Ishaq (pbuh)
became 180 years old, he fell ill and died. Prophet Yaqub and his brother Eish buried
him next to his father Ibrahim (pbuh). As his promise, he built a mosque in Jerusalem
where he poured oil on the stone before. Later Prophet Solomon (pbuh) rebuilt it. Altogether Prophet Yaqub (pbuh) had twelve
sons. One of them was prophet Yusuf (pbuh). At the request of his son, prophet Yaqub (A)
migrated to Egypt with his family and their family known as the Bani Israail. Prophet Ya'qub (A) lived in Egypt for 17 years
and died at the age of 147. This is the end of our story for today, Inshallah,
next time we will enjoy another beautiful story of the prophets."
"Evil Abu Lahab
The bad people were getting worried because their annual Hajj was coming soon. At that time there were 360 idols in the Kabah. Many people used to come from different places
before Hajj time to worship those idols. Animal: So, they did Hajj for the Idols? How come? Wasn't the Kabah the house of God? Yes, it was the house of God, but they thought
their gods were those useless Idols. During the time of Hajj it was a very good
time for business for those who lived in Makkah as well. The bad people thought Muhammad (s)'s ‘Only
One God Idea' would be bad for their business. To solve their problem, all of the non Muslim
Quraysh leaders came to Waleed, who was an old and rich man. After a long discussion, the bad Waleed advised
the people to spread scandals about Muhammad (s) to the new people who would come to Makkah
during Hajj time. We can find this story in the Surah Mudassir. So as their plan, the bad people from the
Quraysh, made some small groups to spread the bad information about Muhammad (s). They started to wait at the different entrances
of Makkah. Whenever they saw the new people, they were
saying, that in that town there was a man, who was claiming himself to be a prophet,
and his name is Muhammad. They made up stories that he was a bad magician,
so whenver he would talk, he would try to spread some new religion, which was breaking
the relationship between families and friends. However, even though this was a terrible thing,
all of the scandals about Muhammad (s) became helpful for Islam. Because of the bad people who started the
rumors, all the new people got the news of the new prophet, and when they left after
their Hajj, people in places all through the other countries also knew about that information,
even though the others have never been to Makkah and never seen or heard the prophet. Because the bad people were trying their extreme
best to make the new people not listen to Muhammad (s), hearing the rumors of the prophet,
the new people were more interested to know about Muhammad (s). But the bad people always tried to give him
a hard time. When Muhammad (s) went to the new people to
talk about Islam, the very bad Abu Lahab walked behind him and would try to disturb him. After the Hajj, when people were returning
to their home, others started to talk about Muhammad (s) and his mission. Very quickly all of Arabia knew about the
new prophet, Muhammad (s). When the bad people's plan did not work, they
tried to stop Muhammad (s). Animal: Really, how did they stop Muhammad
(s)? In three different ways they tried to stop
Muhammad (s). No 1: Making fun of Muslims in front of other
people. No 2: The bad people trying to say that the
Quran did not come from God, and that Muhammad (s) wrote the Quran all by himself. No 3: Not allowing Muslims to read the Quran
in front of people. Whenever Muhammad (s) tried to read the Quran
to a group of people, the nonbelievers scattered the crowd. They were saying that the Quran was a book
of old folk stories. At that time one of the very bad nonbeliever
Nadir bin Harith went to different places to learn different famous old stories. When Muhammad (s) was talking with the people,
that bad guy Nadir began to tell all the famous old stories to the people. It was showing to the people that he could
also could tell stories just like the Quran. He had lots of women slaves, so when someone
started to feel Islam in their heart, he immediately gave them a slave girl with different kinds
of food and drinks to stop them from accepting Islam. In each situation Allah (swt) sent all kinds
of advice and answers to Muhammad (s) in order to deal with non believers. During the 4th year of the prophet hood of
Muhammad (s), the bad people started to give a hard time to the Muslims. At first it started slowly, then day by day
the situation went to extreme, especially in the middle of the 5th year of prophet hood. The nonbelievers felt like Muhammad (s) was
always in their way because they could not harm him. Animal: Why they could not harm Muhammad (s)? Since Muhammad (s) was a very good person,
and since he came from a high family status, the bad people could not say anything to him. Prophet Muhammad (s)'s another source of power
was his uncle, Abu Talib. In that society Abu Talib was very respected
and powerful. Abu Talib was not a Muslim but always supported
Muhammad (s). So the bad Quraysh leaders always tried to
convince Abu Talib not to support Muhammad (s). One day they told Muhammad (s)if he stopped
spreading Islam, then they would make him very rich. Immediately Muhammad (s) refused their offer
and said if they placed the sun in his hand and the moon in his other hand, still he would
not stop spreading Islam. Hearing that, the bad people became very angry. One of his relatives who was also mad after
hearing what the prophet had said, was Abu Lahab. He was Muhammad (s)'s Uncle and his next door
neighbor. Before Islam came, they had a very good relationship. Abu Lahab's two sons married two of Muhammad
(s)'s daughters, Ruqayyah and Kulthum (pbut). But after Muhammad (s) started to spread Allah
(swt)'s laws, Abu Lahab and his wife forced their sons to divorce their wives. They did this so that the prophet would turn
away from Islam. At that time Muhammad (s)'s youngest son Abdullah
died at a very young age. Abu Lahab had a very sick mentality. He became extremely happy because Muhammad
(s) did not have any more sons who were alive. That made Muhammad (s) very sad and heartbroken. So Allah (swt) sent surah Kauther to give
him a very good news and made him happy. Abu Lahab's wife was also a very bad woman. Most of the night, she put some sharp thorns
in front of Muhammad (s)'s door, so he and his family like his children's feet used to
be pricked and their feet used to bleed because of those thorns. She used to spread rumors against Muhammad
(s) all the time. Animal: Abu Lahab and his wife were extremely
very bad people. Allah (s) must be very angry on them. Yes Allah (swt) was very angry for them. So Allah (swt) sent surah Lahab to the prophet. When Abu Lahab’s wife, Umm Jamil, heard
about this surah, Abu Lahab's wife became very angry. She took some stones with her and looked for
prophet Muhammad (s) to hurt him. Abu Bakr (r) and Muhammad (s) were sitting
next to the Ka'bah. When Muhammad (s) saw her coming, he started
to read the Quran. Then a miracle happened. She saw Abu Bakr but she could not see Muhammad
(s), so since she couldn't find the prophet she left. She was so evil that she wanted to sell her
most expensive necklace just to harm Muhammad (s). Abu Lahab and his wife always used to give
the prophet a hard time. Sometimes when he was praying, Abu Lahab put
dirty goat's stomach or animal’s nasty parts all over him. Sometimes Abu Lahab threw some dirty trash
in his food as well."
"Yusuf: Assalamu Alaikum. Ok, Mashallah. That's very good. The stories of the prophet are important for
all Muslims. Insallah, today we will learn about the story
of Prophet Ishaq(pbuh). Are you ready for that? Ok, let start. Bismillah. When Ibrahim and Sarah (pbut) was very old,
the angels came to see them in a human form. The prophet welcomed them as a stranger and
guest. He served them a roasted calf but they did
not eat any food. Prophet Ibrahim started to fear. The angels informed him not to fear because
they were the angels. Animal: Is it same story that Allah (T) send
three angels to destroy the people of Lut (a)? Yusuf: Yes. This is the same story. Before Allah (T) send to angels destroy the
people of Lut, first Allah send them to prophet Ibrahim(pbuh) to give two news. One is bad and one is good. What is the bad news? Animal: Destroy the gay people, I mean people
of Lut. Right. Yusuf: Yes. Masallah. And the good news was, Allah (swt) would give
a son to prophet Ibrahim (pbuh). That son was to be called Ishaq and he was
to be a prophet. Sarah (pbuh) could not believe it was true. She was very old. The angels said that all things are possible
to Allah (T). Then prophet Ishaq (pbuh) was born. Animal: So who is the older son of prophet
Ibrahim(pbuh), Ismail or Ishaq (a)? Yusuf: His older son was Ismail (pbuh). Prophet Ishaq was 10 to 15 years younger than
his half-brother prophet Ismail (pbuh). He was grown up in Palestine with his family. When his time to get married, his father prophet
Ibrahim did not want him  to marry any non-believer, so he sent a  trustworthy servant to Haran in Iraq to choose
a bride for him. Finely he married a very good woman and she
gave birth two sons, Esau and prophet Yaqub (pbuh). Animal: But In English I did not heard about
prophet Yaqub (a). Why? Reason is, in English Yaqub called Jacob. Yaqub and Jacob is the same person. Prophet Ishaq (pbuh) invited people to Allah
(T)'s way in the land of Canaan. He became blind at his old age and settled
with his son Jacob (pbuh) in the village of Hebron which is in Palestine. Then prophet Ishaq fell ill and died when
he was one hundred eighty years old. His sons Esau and Jacob buried him next to
his father Ibrahim (pbuh). This is the end of our today's prophet story."
"Yusuf: Assalamu Alaikum. Ok, Mashallah. That's very good. The stories of the prophet are important for
all Muslims. Insallah, today we will learn about the story
of Prophet Shu’aib (pbuh). Are you ready for that? Ok, let start. Bismillah. The people of Midian were Arabs who lived
in the country of Ma'an, which was south of Jordan. They were greedy people who did not believe
that Allah existed and They worshiped a huge tree called Al-Ayka as a god. That's why they also know as 'people of Ayka'. They were very bad people. They used to rob the people who past their
town and collect tax from travelers. Another major big sin was, they cheated people
with measurement and lied to their customers about their products. Then Allah(T) send Prophet Shu'aib (pbuh)
to guide those people. He was very good speaker and one of the five
Arab Prophets mention in the Quran. Animal: Who are the five Arab Prophets? Yusuf: The five Arab Prophets mention in the
Quran are prophet Hud, Salih, Shu’ayb, Ismail and Muhammad(pbut)). Prophet Shu'aib requested his people to accept
Allah (T) as their God and not to do any cheating in their business. But they only insult him. Man: You are definitely foolish. After many years of trying only small group
of people accepted Allah (swt) as their God. Rest of them even threatened him,:
Man: if you were not small group, we would killed you with stone. They even warned him:
Man: if you don't come to our way, we would throw you out of the city. We don't respect you any more. Prophet Shu'aib (pbuh) inform them he was
the prophet of Allah(T) to guide them the right path and he wanted to keep his wealth
pure by not doing cheat with people. They called him a lier. They thought Prophet shu'aib is doing this
to become rich person. Prophet Shu'aib (pbuh) remained calm and tried
to convinced them, what he was doing was not for his personal benefit. He requested them to follow the one and only
God, Allah (swt). But only few people accept him as a prophet. He remind them what happened to the people
of Nuh, people of hud, saleh and the people of Lut (as). This story was example for them, what happened
to disbelievers. Disbelievers became very angry on him. They forcefully took all the properties from
Prophet Shu'aib (pbuh) and his followers and throw them out of the city. And told them,
Man: if you do follow our roll, you and your followers can come back to the city. All believers refused their condition and
stay outside of the city with strong faith on Allah (swt). Disbelievers even challenge prophet Shu'aib. Man: If you are a true prophet of Allah, bring
the punishment to us. Cut the piece of sky and drop on us. When Prophet Shu'aib (pbuh) did not see any
hope, he requested to bring justice from his Lord Allah (T). Allah accepted his request. Animal: So people of Shuabe (pbuh) and his
followers were in that town? Yusuf: No, they were outside the city. Remember the disbelievers through them out
from the city? Animal: Oh, yes. Now I got it. Than big day was arrived. Allah (T) send them such a severe punishment. He made the weather burning hot for disbelievers. It's like there was no air in the city. People of Madyan were suffering from the lack
of air from the heat. For days after days they went through that
very dry, hot weather. It's like they were boiling in Hell. They were suffering terribly. Finally they saw a massive cloud gathering
in the sky, they thought it would bring cool, refreshing rain. They did not knew, Allah (swt)'s final punishment
were coming from that massive cloud. They became very happy and rushed to outside
to enjoy the rainfall. Suddenly, Allah (swt) shook the ground under
them with big earthquake. The cloud blast with thunder storm and fire. They heard very loud thunder sound which kills
them instantly. They died there on the spot. The evil followers vanished by that horrible
fire punishment. Animal: What happened to their wealth? Yusuf: It was still lying there. The disbelievers used to say, who followed
the disbelievers, they were the looser. Now tell me who are the losser and who are
the winners. Animal: Disbelievers always the looser and
who believe in Allah (swt) they are always the winner. Yusuf: Masallah. Yes who believes on one and only God Allah
(swt) they are always the winner. Prophet Shu'ayb (pbuh) went back to the city
with his followers. After seeing the ruins city, he said he was
not sorry to see them like this, because he warn them about his lord allah (swt) and tried
to give them good advice. But they did not listen to him. Prophet shu'ayb spent the rest of his life
at the city of Madyan. Some Historians suggest that at his old age
prophet Musa came from Egypt, who escaped from the Pharaohs and married his one daughter
but Allah (swt) knows best. This is end of our prophet story for today. Insallah next time we will learn another beautiful
story of  the prophets."
"Yusuf: Assalamu Alaikum. Ok, Mashallah. That's very good. The stories of the prophet are important for
all Muslims. Insallah, today we will learn about the story
of Prophet Yusuf(pbuh). Are you ready for that? Ok, let start. Bismillah. Prophet Yusuf (pbuh) was one of the twelve
sons of Prophet Yaqub, English name Jacob (phuh). His mother's name was Raheel, English name
was Rachel (pbuh). Prophet Yusuf and his mother were most beautiful
person in the earth. He had a younger brother named Benyamin, English
name was Benjamin, from the same mother. Because of their best qualities, their father
loved them more than his other children, and protected them from evil. This made the others children very jealous
to them. One day Yusuf told his father about a dream
he had seen, the sun, the moon and eleven stars bowed down before him. His father prophet Yaqub (pbuh) understood
the meaning of the dream that, Allah (T) would choose him a prophet and gave him a special
power. He was well aware of the jealousy of Yusuf's
step brothers. So, he warned Yusuf (pbuh) not to tell his
dream to his brothers. Prophet Yusuf did not tell his brothers about
his dream. But day by day their jealousy had gotten more
extreme. Animal: So when they decided to kill prophet
Yusuf (as)? When Yusuf (pbuh) was eighteen years old,
their brothers sat down to discuss what to do with Yusuf (pbuh). Brother: Let’s kill Yusuf. Our father love him most. Brother2: Don’t kill him. If you must do, throw him down to the bottom
of a well. He will be picked up by some travelers and
take him with them to a distant land. As their plan they asked their father, prophet
Yaqub (pbuh), Son: Father, why don’t you trust us with
Yusuf? Let him come with us to enjoy. We will take care of him. Prophet Yaqub (pbuh) said, he was scared to
leave him with them. If they were careless, wolf might come and
kill him. Son: We are strong enough to protect him,
otherwise we would be the losers. Finally they convinced their father to take
Yusuf (pbuh) with them. As their plan they took him to the well. After removed his shirt, they through him
into the deep well. Poor Yusuf cried to save him but their cruel
hearts did not saved him. They left him alone in that well. But Allah (T) kept prophet Yusuf safe in that
well. On the way they killed a sheep and soaked
Yusuf’s shirt in its blood. Before return home they took oath to keep
their secret. At night they go back to their father and
started to cry. Prophet Yaqub (pbuh) asked them what happened. They answered with crying. Son: Father, we were racing and left Yusuf
with our staff. Then a wolf came and eat him. Please believe us, we are telling the truth. They showed his shirt with false blood. Animal: Did prophet Yusuf's father prophet
Yaqub (pbuh) realized that they were were lying? Animal: I think he did, because he was prophet
of Allah (swt). Yusuf: Yes, he realized that Prophet Yusuf's
step brothers were telling lie. Their father hold the shirt and asked them
how came wolf ate his son without tearing his shirt. Their faces turned red but swore by Allah
that they were telling the truth. Prophet Yaqub’s eyes were full of tears
and told them they were telling lie but he would keep patience because only Allah (T)
can help him and his son. In the dark well young Yusuf was scared and
asked forgiveness from his creator Allah (T) and surrendered himself to the will of his
lord. Next day a caravan was going to Egypt. On the way, they stop by the well for water. One men lowered his bucket and prophet Yusuf
(pbuh) hold the rope. When the man saw a young boy, he shouted to
his people. Man: Give me hand. Looks like I found real treasure in the well! They helped him to pull the well. They saw a handsome beautiful healthy young
boy with angelic smile. They immediately feel, if they sold him as
a slave, they could make lots to money. So they right way clapped chain to him and
took him with them to Egypt, far away from his homeland of Canaan. All over the Egyptian city the news spread
that an unusually handsome, healthy young slave was
on sale. People gathered by the hundreds at the slave
market. Many rich people tried to buy him but the
chief minister of Egypt, Mr. Aziz win the bid and took yusuf (pbuh) to his mansion. And told his wife Zulaikha, to be good to
him, may be they should adopt him as their son. This way Allah (T) established Yusuf (pbuh)
in one of the ruling class of Egypt. The chief minister ordered his men to remove
the chain from his feet and told Yusuf (pbuh) not to break his trust. Yusuf (pbuh) thanked him and promised to be
trustful. He thanked Allah (T) over and over for her
new life. But he missed very much his parents and his
little brother Benyamin. The chief minister's wife was very happy with
Yusuf (pbuh) for his charming behavior and manners. People of town referred him as the most attractive
man they had ever seen. They even wrote poem about him. He was always humble and polite to every one. By the age to twenty Allah (T) gave him special
wisdom and knowledge. His master put him in charge of his household
and treated him as a son. But his master’s wife, Zulaikha got evil
feeling to Yusuf (pbuh). Her evil feeling tried to win the Prophet
Yusuf’ heart but she failed. One day sytan, inspire her to close the door
when prophet Yusuf came in the room and invite him to do the evil act. It was the test for Yusuf (pbuh) because she
was very beautiful woman in the town. He win the Test and refuged her for the sake
of Allah (T), because Allah (T) guided him not to betray his master and away from any
evil act. So he moved to the door to escape and she
ran after him, hold his shirt. In her tugging she tore his shirt and held
the torn piece in her hand. After opened the door, her husband saw them
in that position. Immediately she changed her tone and blame
Yusuf (pbuh) for that situation. She falsely claimed that prophet Yusuf attacked
her forcefully and request her husband to punished him. Animal: What?! She's lying
Animal: She must be a bad woman. But Prophet Yusuf denied her complain and
said to her husband that she had a feeling to him. Then the husband asked one of the house member
to tell the truth. The house member explain if his shirt was
torn from the front, she is telling truth or if his shirt torn from the back he is telling
the truth. The husband realized that his wife is telling
the lie, prophet Yusuf (pbuh) was innocent. He let Yusuf (pbuh) go and told her wife to
asked forgiveness from Yusuf (pbuh). The story was spread everywhere by the house
servants. People started to gossip. To express her situation, she invited some
rich women for a special dinner. She told them that, she had an evil feeling
about him and that feeling she had for a longtime for him. After finishing their dinner, the guests began
cutting their fruit with knife. At that moment she called Yusuf (pbuh) to
come in to the dining room. Everybody was surprise to see the most beautiful
man in the earth. They were so surprise that they accidently
cut their palm, while they were cutting the fruits. They could not believe that he was a real
human. Everyone had same kind of evil feeling to
get him. Then Mrs. Aziz told them for this man they
are blaming her. She told them, “you cut your hands to see
his beauty.” Their evil feeling wanted to get him. Minister wife treated him, if he did not obey
her, he had to go to jail. But the prophet Yusuf (pbuh) did not obey
her, he prefer went to jail. So, she convinced her husband to sent him
to prison to save her honor. The chief minister knew Yusuf (pbuh) was innocent
but he did not had a choice. So he send him to prison with sad feeling. At that time he was about twenty years old. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Animal: How could they send such an innocent person to prison? Animal: Because they were really bad people! That was another test for him from Allah (T). During that period Allah (T) gave him an extraordinary
gift. He could understand the meaning of Dream. In prison he had two prisoner with him. They both saw different dream. They asked the meaning of the dream from Yusuf
(pbuh). One prisoner dream was, “I was carrying
the bread on my head and birds were eating my bread from the head”. Other prisoner dream was, “I was making
wine.” First, Yusuf (pbuh) invite them to the way
of Allah(T) and believe him as a one and only God. That was the same religion that Prophet Ibrahim,
Ishaq and Yaqub (pbut) followed. Then he told the first prisoner, “he would
be crucified and birds would eat from his head. Then he told to the other prisoner, he would
be released and served his wine to the king. He request this prisoner, to mention about
him to the king that he was innocent. Dream come true, first person was crucified
and the second person was released and worked for the king but Satan made him forget to
mention prophet Yusuf name to the king. So, Yusuf (pbuh) was in prison for a few more
years but he was in patience and pray to Allah (T). after nine years the king saw a dream. Seven fat cows come out of the river followed
by seven skinny cows. The seven skinny ones eat the seven fat ones. The king was terrified. Then king saw the seven grains are green and
another seven grains are dry. He asked his entire official to explain the
meaning of the dream but no one could tell the meaning. Suddenly the old prisoner remembered Yusuf
(pbuh) who tell the meaning of his dream in the prison. He ran to the king to tell about Yusuf (pbuh)
and recommended him the right person to tell the meaning of this dream. King sent him to Yusuf (pbuh) to get the meaning. He explain the dream, seven years would be
good harvest. During this time the excess food should be
saved. Next seven years would be bad drought. No food would be grew. This time the saved excess food could be used. He also advised to save some grain for seed
to harvest after the drought. He also said, after seven years of drought,
there would be lots of rain. That water could be used for grape and olive
trees to fulfill their need of juice and oil. After hearing that, the king was amazed. He commanded his people to released Yusuf
(pbuh) at once but prophet Yusuf refused to leave the prison unless the king proved him
innocent. The king order to bring the Aziz’s wife
and all the ladies who cut their hands. They felt shame what they had in their mind
and felt sorry to send an innocent man to prison. Aziz wife were very sorry for what she done. She declare that Yusuf (pbuh) was innocent
and she is the guilty one. After that the Zulaikha’s story was end
there. Animal:why does her story is end there? Yusuf: There were many made up folk stories
about her. According to the Quran and Hadith no story
about her was accepted. So we have to end her story here. New life started 
for  Prophet Yusuf (pbuh). The king recognized his noble qualities and
wide knowledge. He wanted to know from Yusuf (pbuh) how they
should protect themselves from the long drought. Prophet Yusuf offered the king to give him
the full control over all store houses of the Egypt and he could protect them with his
knowledge, that Allah (T) gave him. That was kind of finance minister of Egypt. The king was happy for his proposal and gave
the full control of store houses. That miracle way, Allah (T) gave prophet Yusuf
(pbuh) the full power in the land of Egypt. Time goes by so fast. First seven good years, he had full control
over the farming and storage of crops. Then drought started for next seven years
in everywhere, including prophet Yusuf’s homeland, Cannan. Yusuf (pbuh) advised the king to sell some
of their extra reserved grain to needy nations at a fair price. The king agreed, and the good news spread
all over the region. Prophet Yaqub (pbuh) send all of his sons
except Benyamin, English name was Benjamin, to Egypt to purchase some food. Yusuf (pbuh) heard the ten brothers came from
Cannan and they could not speak the Egyptian language. Prophet Yusuf (pbuh) immediately recognized
his step brothers but they did not know him. They introduced themselves as the children
of noble prophet Yaqub (pbuh) and they are altogether eleven brother. ______________________________________________________________ Their youngest brother was with their old
father. On hearing this, his heart filled with tears. He missed his parents and brother for long
time. After giving them their supplies, he told
them if they were truthful, bring their youngest brother next time and he would treat them
good. But if they could not bring him, they were
not allowed to come and get any supply next time. They said, “We shall try to get permission
from our father and we will do that.” Yusuf (pbuh) ordered his servant to secretly
put the money they had paid for their supplies, into one of their supply bag. So they became grateful and might come back. Ten brothers return to their father. And told,
“if we don’t take our brother with us next time, no more food we will get. Please send him with us, we shall protect
him.” Prophet Yaqub (pbuh) told, he could not trust
them for Benyamin protection, because they could not protect another brother Yusuf (pbuh). He only depended Allah (T)’s protection
and mercy. Animal: So, what happend to the money that
prophet Yusuf secretly put in their supplies? Later, when they opened their bag, they were
surprised to find their money was back. They rushed to their father and told,
“look father! The officer has returned our money; he will
not harm our brother, it would be good for us.” But Yaqub (pbuh) refused to send Benyamin
with them. After some time, when they had no more food,
Yaqub (pbuh) asked them to travel to Egypt for more. They reminded him, they could no return without
Benyamin. Finaly, Yaqub (pbuh) agreed and got promise
in the name of Allah (T) from them that they would bring him back safely. He also advised them to enter the city through
different gates. Yaqub (pbuh) prayed to Allah (T) for their
safty. In their long journey to Egypt, they took
good care of Benyamin. They enter the city from different gates. Finaly they meet Yusuf (pbuh). He immediately recognized his brother Benyamin
and arranged for all the brothers to take a rest at night.When everybody is in sleep,
he called his brother, Banyamin to talk. Then Yusuf (pbuh) introduced himself as his
lost brother. After many years of separation their heart
melt, eye filled with tears with joy and hugged each other. But they decided to keep it secret from their
step brothers. The next day, while all brothers filled their
bag with food, Yusuf (pbuh) order one of his people to place king’s golden bowl in the
Beniyamin’s bag. When the brothers were ready to leave, the
solders close the gates and shouted: “you travelers are thieves”. The brothers surprised and asked,
“What have you lost?” one soldier said, “The king’s golden bowl.” Another person said,
“Who could find that, he will get a camel load reward.” The brothers told,
“By Allah! We did not came to do evil job in this county
and we are not thieves.” They asked,
“What punishement you will get if you tell a lie.” The brothers said,
“According to our law, whoever steals becomes a slave to the owner of the property.” The solder said, “Ok, we shall apply your
law instead of the Egyptian law.” Yusuf (pbuh) was happy with that because by
Egyptian law he could not keep his brother with him. The solders started the searching one by one
all the brothers bag. Finally they found the golden bowl in the
Benyamin’s bag. His brothers shouted,
“there were no surprise that he steal, before his brother also stool.” Animal: It's sad how they could say something
bad about Prophet Yusuf (pbuh)…. (sadly) Hearing this Yusuf (pbuh) was quite and thinking
they were very bad people, Allah (T) knows best. Then they remember the promise, they did to
their father and request to Yusuf (pbuh), ”O Master! His father is very old man. Take one of us and let him go. We see you are a good man.” He refused their offer and said it would not
be right thing to do. When they did not see any hope, all brothers
go on side and started to talk themselves. Their eldest brother was very worried and
told others, “We promised our father in the name of Allah not to lose him. So, I will not go back without our permission. Or Allah (T) decides for me.” so, he stayed behind and other brothers went
back to their father, Yaqub (pbuh). In the meantime Yusuf (pbuh) kept Benyamin
in his house as his guest. Benyamin was happy that oldest brother stayed
behind for him because he was a good brother among others. Animal: Why Yusuf (pbuh) let them to go back? Why he did not tell that he was their brothers? Yusuf: This time Yusuf (pbuh) tried to test
their feelings and sincerity about Benyamin. He wanted to see if they would come back for
left behind two brothers. All nine brothers return to their father and
told, “Father, your son has stolen but we did
not see him to steal. We are telling the truth. You can asked others from the caravan.” After hearing that, their father Yaqub (pbuh)’s
heart filled with sorrow and tears were droping from his eyes. He kept patience. Did not loose hope from Allah (T). he wised,
may be Allah (T) would return all of his children. He was deeply hurt and cried all the time
for his lost son beloved Yusuf and other sons. Within a few days he lost his sight and became
blind. Animal: He became blind?! (surprised)
Animal: He must be have loved his children very much. Yusuf: Yes. He truly did love them. His other sons tried to give him comfort but
nothing helped him. He requested them to go back to Egypt and
search for Yusuf (pbuh) and his brother. Animal: How he know about Yusuf (as)? Because his heart was telling him, his son
Yusuf (pbuh) was still alive. By that time their food supplied also finished. All the brothers became very poor and depressed. They came to Egypt and find their big brother. All together they meet Yusuf (pbuh) and inform
him that, their family was in very hard time. They bagged to him for more food because they
did not had full money to buy. In that heartbreaking moment, he asked them,
what they did to their brother Yusuf and Benyamin. They were socked to hear that. They knew, no one could not know about their
act to Yusuf (pbuh) beside Allah (T), themselves and Yusuf himself. They right away realized that the person in
front of them was their brother Yusuf( pbuh). “Are you Yusuf?” Prophet Yusuf (pbuh) confirm that he was Yusuf
and remind them Allah (T) give reward who keep in patient. All brothers became shame for their big sin
and announced that Allah (T) gave highest position then all of them. They asked pardon from him. Yusuf (pbuh) pardon them and pray for them
to get forgiveness from Allah (T) for their sin. They hugged Yusuf (pbuh) with joy. Animal: So did prophet Yusuf go back to his
father? Yusuf: No, because he had big responsibility
in Egypt. So Allah (T) wanted him to stay there and
brought his full family member to Egypt. So he advised his brother to take his shirt
to his father. They started their journey to go back to Palestine. On the other hand, the Prophet Yaqub (pbuh)
was in his room and crying for his sons. Suddenly he felt good and came out from his
room. He lifts up his face to Heaven and took a
deep breath. His face glowed with beautiful smile. He told other, he could get the smell of Yusuf
(pbuh) in the air. Their family member told him that he was wrong. But prophet of Allah (T) got the good news
in advance. When the caravan came and one of his son put
Yusuf(pbuh)’s shirt on his face, Allah (T) cure his eyes right away. He confirmed every one that, Allah (T) inform
this to him before. All the sons requested him to asked forgiveness
from Allah (T) for their big sin. Then he asked forgiveness to the most Merciful
one and only Allah (swt). As his son Yusuf's (pbuh) advice Prophet Yaqub
(pbuh) moved to Egypt with his full family. They meet Yusuf (pbuh) at the outside of Town. Prophet Yusuf and Yaqub (pbut) hugged each
other with joy. Prophet Yusuf took them to the city. When he sat in the throne next to his parents,
every one bowed to him in prostration. He reminded his father the dream he saw at
very young age. That was the explanation of the dream. He was very grateful to Allah (swt) for his
new life and brought his family to him. He Pray to Allah (T) to keep him as a Muslim
during his death and give him paradise hereafter. At the age of one hundred ten he died at Egypt. We don't know where he buried. Some scholar said, after his death, he was
mummified and placed in a coffin and letter buried beside his forefather, at Palestine. But Allah (T) know best. This is end of our prophet story for today. Insallah, we will learn another prophet story
next time."
"Torturing against Muslims
Also another very bad guy was Abu Jahl. One day Muhammad(s) was praying next to the
Kabah. Abu Jahl told another bad guy to bring some
animal nasty parts. When Muhammad (s) bowed down during his prayer,
they threw all that nasty things on him and started to laugh. Then Muhammad (s)'s youngest daughter Fatima
(pbuh) came to help him. Abu Jahl could never stand it when the prophet
would come to the kabbah to pray and would always get very angry. One day he decided to hold Muhammad (s)'s
face on the ground during his prayer. Some of his bad friends were waiting to see
his evil action. But after taking few steps he saw a big fire
in front of him. Abu Jahl became very scared and stepped back
right away. That miracle fire protected Muhammad (s) from
the humiliation in front of the people. Animal: What Abu Jahl used to do when someone
became Muslim? Abu Jahl was so bad, that if any powerful
people accepted Islam, he became very mad and used very bad words to insult them. But if any poor people accepted Islam, he
gave them a very bad physical punishment. Another bad Quraish was Umaya. Whenever he saw Muhammad (s), he started to
say bad words to the prophet. One day one of Umaya's friends was talking
to Muhammad (s). Umaya became very upset at his friend and
ordered him to go to Muhammad (s) and spit on the prophet’s face. And they were so bad that his friend actually
went up to the prophet and spat on the holy prophet's face! The bad people hurt the Muslims at that time
mentally and physically. At that time a black slave named Bilal (pbuh)
accepted Islam with his whole heart but his owner, Umayya, did not like that. So he started to give a big punishment to
Bilal (pbuh). At first the bad Umayya tied a rope around
Bilal (pbuh)'s neck and dragged him outside with some help of bad street youngsters. Then they took him to a sandy area on very
hot sunny day. The reason for that is because he wanted Bilal
to suffer in the burning sun, and in the desert it’s extremely hot. They threw him to that very hot sand and put
a very big rock on his chest. All that time Bilal (pbuh) was saying again
and again that, God is One, God is One. With that terrible punishment he never lost
his faith from Allah (swt). So as a reward Allah (swt) sent Abu Bakr (pbuh)
to save him. At that time the rich Abu Bakr (pbuh) bought
him from Umayya and let him go as a free man. Animal: It was very sad that non believer
used to punish the Muslim for their faith to Islam. Yes, it was very sad situation. At that time, many new Muslims were terribly
punished by the nonbelievers. One a Sahaba of the prophet got a terrible
punishment by his own uncle. That bad uncle rolled up that Sahaba with
a mat, and hung him over the fire. Another Sahaba, Mus'ab (pbuh) was punished
by his own mother. That Sahaba came from a very rich family. After Mus'ab became Muslim, his mom became
very angry and stopped giving any food or water to his own son. Soon after a while she threw him out from
the house, which made it very hard for him to survive. There was another Sahaba named Ammar, and
his parents (pbut) were slaved. They all accepted Islam but their owner was
very bad and he did not like that they converted. Since their owner was very bad, he teamed
up with the bad Abu Jahl and bad up an evil plan. During the extreme hot and sunny day, their
owner tied them up outside and placed a heavy stone on top of them. Every day, Abu Jahl forced them to say bad
things about prophet Muhammad (s) and say good things about their idols. But they refused to say anything bad about
Muhammad (s). One day Ammar (pbuh)'s father died because
of the extreme punishments that they were giving him. At the same time Ammar (pbuh)'s mother was
very old. One day Abu Jahl became very angry for her
strong faith in Allah (swt). So the bad Abu Jahl killed her with extreme
pain. Her name was Sumaya (pbuh) and she was the
first Muslim women killed for Islam. Animal: So, was she the first Muslim who was
killed for Islam? Yes and also she was a very good black women. Then Abu Jahl started to give more painful
punishments to Ammar (pbuh) day and night. With the extreme pain that he was going through,
one day during a horrible punishment, Ammar (pbuh) accepted Abu Jahl order but in heart
he had a very strong faith in Allah (swt) and he did not mean what he said. There was another rich women who also tortured
her Muslim slave as well. His name was Khabbab (pbuh), and since his
faith in Islam was so strong, his owner decided to punish him with a burning iron. One day the bad people forced him to lie down
in the burning coal. In another situation, some of the non believers
were extremely bad that one time they punished a slave women by blinding her because of her
faith to Allah (swt). Later as a miracle Allah (swt) healed her
eyes, so that she could see again. Seeing that, the bad people started to say
that it was magic done by Muhammad (s), which was not true. Another bad non believer tied his Muslim slave,
Abu Fukaihah, and took off all his clothes. Then they dragged him on a very rough rocky
pathway, which took him from one place to another. Then the bad guys placed a big stone on that
sahaba so he could not move at all. After that horrible punishment, he became
unconscious and lost all of his sense. The non believers gave him that daily punishment,
but he did not lose his faith in Allah (swt). After seeing many of these sufferings, that
the Muslim slaves at that time had to go through, the prophet Muhammad became very sad. Some of the rich Muslims decided to buy those
Muslim slaves so that they could set them free. In that case, since Abu Bakar was very rich,
he did a very good job of turning those Muslim slaves free. Animal: Where Muhammad (s) used to meet with
other Muslims? In those terrible times, Muslims needed a
secret place for their meetings. One of the great Sahaba Al-Arqam gave up his
house for the Muslims. It was next to as Safa Hill and it was very
easy to enter or exit secretly because of the narrow street by his house. This was known as the house of AlArqam. It became the first house of Islam and the
first Islamic school with Muhammad (s)'s teachings."

"Assalmu Alaikum! So are you ready for today's story? Inshallah,  I will tell you the story of
Hazrat Hussain (Rali Allahu Anhu) today! Bismillah! The story of
 Imam Hussain (Rali Allahu Anhu)  Imam Hussain (Rali Allahu Anhu) was the grandson of Prophet
Muhammad (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) He was the son of
Hazrat Ali Ibn Ali Talib, and Hazrat Fatima (Rali Allahu Anha). The Prophet loved Hazrat Hussain 
and his brother a lot.  There are many instances
where he have said  “He who loves me and loves these two, their father and their mother,
 will be with me at my place on the day of resurrection. On another occasion, he said  “Hussain is of me and I am of him. Allah loves those who love Hussain. Hussain is a grandson among grandsons. After the death of the Prophet,
his mother too passed away. And in a few years,
his father died as well, making his brother
 Hazrat Hassan the Imam. Hazrat Hussain had to take over
 the responsibility of Imama. after his brother died. In the meantime, Muawiyah,
the companion of the Prophet, and someone who had a lot of
disagreements with the Prophet's family which included the great battle of Siffin
against Imam Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) had appointed his son
Yazid as his successor. This was against the treaty made by
his brother and the Muawiyah A messnger is now standing
before Hussain(Rali Allahu Anhu) Yazid wanted Hazrat Hussain
to pay allegiance to him  and follow his leadership, but Hazrat Hussain refused. This angered Yazid One day, while Hazrat Hussain was in Mecca  doing his pilgrimage, he got the
news that the people over Iraq had a message for him they wanted to
 pledge allegiance to him and his family. Not to Muawiyah and Yazid. Hazrat Hussain received  over five hundred
letters from Iraq. He headed to Kufa where
 he was offered allegiance  from the people living there. Before reaching the city of Kufa,  he asked his cousin Muslim
Ibn Aqeel to go to Kufa    to assess the situation there But the situation in Kufa had changed.  Yazid’s army had already bribed
the people of Kufa.  And they swore allegiance to Yazid. When Muslim arrived at the city, he was greeted by some of the people who 
wanted to pay allegiance to Hazrat Hussain . but Yazid's army found out
he was in the city he was then killed when he didn't pay allegiance to Yazid. Hazrat Hussain didn’t realize
the situation in Kufa, the companions of the prophet
warned him from going to Kufa, but he continued and his
journey to the city Suddenly they were surrounded
by Hur and the his army near Al-Qadissiyah Hur worked for Yazid, and he had been instructed to stop
the family proceeding any further to Kufa. Hur asked Imam Hussain (RA) ""Where are you going
O grandson of the prophet?"" The Imam reply "" To Iraq"" and Hur said back to him. ""I order you to turn back
and not to go to Kufa"" Nevertheless Imam Hussain (RA) still
went on his way to Iraq. The family then reached Karbala. They remained there for two days,  from the 2nd until the 4th of Muharram. But soon, Shimr arrived along
with four thousand soldiers. Hazrat Hussain thought about his family. The people in Imam Hussain's camp,  consisted of men over 80 years old,
and women and children. He finally decided to comply
considering the safety of his family. Shimr and his soldiers
soon occupied the camp. He ordered Hazrat Hussain (RA) to pay
allegiance to Yazid. But Hazrat Hussain (RA) didn't comply On the 9th of Muharram Hazrat Hussain saw that the army of Yazid
were approaching his camp. He asked his brother Abbas,
to meet the soldiers  and find out what was happening When Abbas spoke to the soldiers, they said they had received orders
to find Hazrat Hussain if he didn't pay allegiance to Yazid. When Abbas informed this to Hazrat Hussain,  he realized that his end was near. Hazrat Hussain requested that they be given one more night
for worshipping Allah. The army agreed, and granted them
 one more day to live. That night, the entire family prayed
and worshipped Allah (Subhanahu wa ta'ala).  Even though they knew they
were going to die the next day,  the family stayed strong and together. After the prayers,  Hazrat Hussain held a meeting for
his family and companions. He told them that Yazid wanted to kill
 him alone, and not his family.  He asked them to leave the
camp and save their lives. But no one wanted to leave! They were willing to give up their life
for the family of the Prophet. They swore their allegiance till they die. Let us remember Hur, the leader of the  army who initially
stopped Hazrat Hussain  from entering Kufa He realized that he was on the
wrong side of the battle. When he thought about killing the
Prophet’s surviving family, he was horrified! Hur,and his son and four soldiers walk
toward Hussain's camp When he met the Imam,
he was overcome with grief. He begged for forgiveness and
pleaded with him to fight for him. On the morning of the 10th of Muharram,  Hazrat Hussain led his family
 and companions in prayers. Not only that, he also led the prayers of
the opposing side as well. And after the prayers were finished
they saw the army approaching, they lined up outside their tents
to defend themselves. They were 72, facing a giant army of 
thousands of soldiers! Hur was the first to fight in the battle. But he stood no chance against
an army of thousands.  Even though he fought bravely,
he was soon killed. They fought all morning very bravely. The fighting continued throughout
the afternoon and soon  all the companions were martyred,  leaving only the family members. Imam’s nephew, the son of
Hazrat Hassan (Rali Allahu Anhu),  Hazrat Qasim approached Imam and requested him to go out
into the battlefield. But Imam denied his request Hazrat Qasim was upset, so he approached his mother
and spoke to her. It was then she handed over a letter,  and asked him to give this to his uncle. The letter was written by
Imam Hassan (Rali Allahu Anhu) before he died. He knew that this day would come soon, and that’s why he requested his brother
 to let his son fight for him. Imam Hussain was forced
to give his permission,  and Hazrat Qasim went
into the battlefield. But he too died very soon. Finally, Imam Hussain went
out to the battlefield.  He introduced himself again as the
grandson of the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) and that his only crime was that he would
not take the oath of allegiance  to Yazid and his sinful ways. Soon, Shimr and his army
approached Hazrat Hussain he fought many of them bravely. But numbers greater than bravery and he was soon killed after. “Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un ” One day the whole mini army:  the male family members and companions
 of Imam Hussain were martyred.  By the evening, the only surviving
male member of the family, Hazrat Zain Ul Abideen, the noble ladies
of the house and children were left. Allah knows best and has a plan. Hazrat Zain Ul Abideen had not
fought in the battle at Karbala because he had been severely ill,  he had a high fever that had made
 him unable to lift his head. He was the only male companion for
 the noble ladies and children. On the night of the 10th of Muharram the ladies were now imprisoned They began their long journey through
the hot deserts of Karbala. They travelled through the burning sands through the towns of Tikrit,
 Mosul and Aleppo. Those pious ladies were taken to
Syria where Bibi Zainab,  the brave sister of
Imam Hussain confronted Yazid. She stood before him and told the
 world about the atrocities  that the family of the
 Prophet had endured. Yazid was ridiculed by this powerful lady and people now knew 
the story of Karbala. Zainab then died after she
had revealed the truth. It was the destiny of this pious lady
to spread the story of Karbala.  If it hadn’t have been for her, the whole story could have been suppressed and forgotten in the hot desert. Through all her pain and suffering
she was able to keep the story alive"
"Assalmu Alaikum! So are you ready for today's story? Bismillah! The Story of Imam Hassan(RA) Imam Hassan (Rali Allahu Anhu) was
 born on the 3rd year of Hijrah,  in a small house made of mud. He was the son of
Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu), and Hazrat Fatima (Rali Allahu Anha). It was the Prophet who named
the little boy ‘Hassan’ Hazrat Hassan was brought
 up in the lap of his father. And the Prophet was his school, from whom he learned many things. He was very fond of his younger
 brother Imam Hussain (Rali Allahu Anhu) Imam Hassan was loved by
the Prophet so much. When he was a child, he accompanied
the prophet to a gathering. The Prophet was delivering a speech there when he saw the sound
of the little boy weeping. He stopped his speech, and came down to calm him. He put the boy in his lap
 and announced to everyone “Whosoever loves me, must love this child as well."" Ablution means cleaning oneself. Imam Hassan (Rali Allahu Anhu) and
 his brother had grown up by now. One day they went to the mosque
for offering their prayers. At the mosque they saw an old person
performing ablution in a wrong way They wanted to let him know that  without offending him. He and Hussain decided on a plan to show
him the correct way of performing ablution. They stood in front of him,
and started arguing with each other. Hassan (Rali Allahu Anhu)
said to his brother  “I perform better ablution
as compared to yours” To this Hussain (Rali Allahu Anhu) replied “No mine is better, everyone knows that” They then turned to the old man and sought his advice. “Can you please come and see our ablution.  Please tell us who
 performs a better ablution.” The old man agreed. Both of the young men
started performing ablution The Old man realized that they
were putting up with this act to teach him the correct
way of performing ablution. He then told them  “The ablution performed by
both of you is correct.  I am an old man.  I was doing it in the incorrect way. You made me aware of my fault.  I am so thankful to you. The old man performed the ablution
in the correct way that time, and both the brothers walked away happily. Imam Hassan (Rali Allahu Anhu)  was the most devoted and pious
worshipper of Allah (Subhanahu wa ta'ala). Whenever he went to Mecca for
 pilgrimage, he used to go on foot. Whenever he stood for his prayers, he saw himself in the court of God. His body would start trembling
and he would say  “Oh God, this is your guest
standing in your court. Your defaulter servant has come to you. He hopes that you will
forgive his bad deeds” One day Imam Hassan (Rali Allahu Anhu)  was riding a horse, and crossing a street. He came across a man who he knew
was one the friends of Muawiyah. They had disagreements with Prophet
Muhammad (Peace be upon him)'s family. When the man realized who Hassan was, he started abusing him using foul language. Imam Hassan stopped and listened to him. Then he said “You are a traveller
and not a local person. You have been provoked,
and fed lies by our enemies. That is why you are using
such  bad language” “If you have a need, then I will try to fulfil it.  If you are hungry, then I can feed you. If you need clothes,
then I will get it for you. If you don’t have a house to live in ,  then I will take you to my house
and take care of you” When that disrespectful person heard this, he was overcome with shame and grief He started weeping,
 and apologized to Imam. “I am so sorry.  Your enemies had been telling me so many
lies about your father and your people.  But now I know the truth. I have witnessed your courtesy, and you are the most respectful
and gracious among all people.” Shortly later, that man got
 converted into Islam and defended the faith till
the time of his death. Imam Hassan (Rali Allahu Anhu)  had the misfortune of witnessing many of
the early tragedies that befell Islam,  including the death of the Prophet The death of his mother The denial of his father’s leadership And then the turbulent period during
his fathers tenure as the Caliph. Following the death of his father
Imam Ali, he became a responsible leader. He encountered a rampant corruption which
was present everywhere in Muslim empire,  and was forced to enter a
peace treaty with Muwaiya. Imam Hassan's death however, 
has drawing closer It was the 28th day of Safar,  and the 50th Hijrah, and Imam Hassan was fasting as usual. It was on that day that he drank
his milk when it was presented to him to break his fast. He drank a portion of the poisonous milk  and he immediately knew the truth. Several people, including the Imam's
brother Hussain (Rali Allahu Anhu) walked into check on him. Imam Hassan's health got worse and he said to his brother. ""I have tasted poison three times, but I am never had a more
terrible poison such of this."" Hussain (Rali Allahu Anhu) replied, ""Who poisoned you brother?' Imam Hassan said back to him ""And what would you do
 if I told you? Do you wish to fight? I leave them to Allah the Almighty. Even before his death Iman Hassan had such
nobility and kindness. Imam Hassan (Rali Allahu Anhu)
passed away facing severe pain and discomfort. He was buried in the
graveyard of Baqia in Medina. But just before his death, he entrusted the affairs of Imamat  to his brother Imam Hussain, and made him the
guardian of his own family. Inshallah,  I will tell you the story of
Imam Hussain (Rali Allahu Anhu) tomorrow."
"Assalmu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! So are you ready for today's story? Yes I am!
Which story are you going to tell me today? Inshallah, I will tell you the
story of Hazrat Fatima (Rali Allahu Anha) One day Prophet  Muhammad (Sallallahu
 Alaihi Wasallam) came to her house,  said salaams to her. Fatima returned his greetings Prophet asked her to cover him with the
Yemeni blanket as He was feeling weak. Fatima did like He asked Her,
and covered Him with the blanket. She noticed that Her father’s face
was shining like a moon! Some time later, Her son
 Hasan  came and salaam.  He could smell the fragrance
 of his grandfather and asked his mother if He was here. Fatima returned his salaams and told him
that his grandfather was inside the blanket Al-Hassan moved towards the cloak and said,  ""Peace be upon you, O grandfather. Will you allow me to be with
you under this cloak?"" Prophet replied, ""Peace be upon you too, my son and
director of my Pond.  I allow you."" Al-Hasan then went under the
 cloak with his grandfather Shortly afterward His son
Al-Hussain came, ""Peace be upon you, mother!"" he greeted. ""Peace be upon you, too” she replied. ""O mother,"" he said, ""I can smell a
 pleasing scent of my grandfather."" ""Yes, it is,"" I answered, ""Your grandfather
 and your brother are now under the cloak."" Al-Hussain moved towards
the cloak and said, ""Peace be upon you, O grandfather. Will you allow me to be with
you under this cloak?"" Prophet replied, ""Peace be upon you too,
my son. I allow you.""  Al-Hussain then went under the cloak
with his grandfather at t the same time, Hazrat Ali came in, ""Peace be upon you” he greeted Fatima. ""Peace be upon you too"" she replied. He then said, ""Fatimah,
 I can smell a pleasing scent, as if it is the scent of my brother and
cousin the Messenger of Allah."" ""Yes,"" she answered, ""He is there with
your two sons under the cloak."" Ali moved towards the cloak and said, ""Peace be upon you, O Allah’s Messenger! Will you allow me to be with
you under the cloak?"" Prophet replied, ""Peace be upon you too. I allow you."" Ali thus went with them under the cloak. Fatima then said,
""Peace be upon you father, Will you allow me to be
with you under the cloak?"" ""Peace be upon you too, my daughter
 and part of my flesh. I allow you.""  This way Fatima too went
with them under the cloak. When all of them were together
underneath the cloak, the Prophet held the two ends
 of the cloak  and raised his right hand towards the
 heavens and prayed “O Allah, these are the people of my
household, the Ahl al- Bayt. They are of my flesh and blood.  Whoever makes them unhappy,
 makes me unhappy. They are from me and I am from them. Send your blessings and
mercy on me and them.  Repel all blemishes from them
and keep them pure as pure.” Allah then spoke to His angels and said he had created the whole of the
universe for the love of the five who were under the cloak. Angel Jibraeel asked
who was under the cloak. Allah replied that they are the
household of the Messenger. Jibrael was then sent to
the house of Fatima. After getting the permission of
the Prophet, he entered the cloak. Angel then told them what Allah had said
and recited the Ayat Al-Tathir sent by Allah in praise 
of the Ahl al- Bayt. Hadees e Kisa brings many benefits.  One’s sins will be forgiven,
and his hurdles will be resolved. The Hadees e Kisa shows that Bibi Fatima  is the link between the
 Prophet and the Imams. She is the centre of Purity
and the Panjatan e Paak. One must recite this hadees
atleast once a week. One day, a rich jew came to the Prophet’s house
 for inviting Fatima to his daughter's wedding The Prophet told them that he will ask
his daughter and inform them. He told Fatima about the invitation, and she said she will seek the
 permission of her husband. Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu) gave his approval and Fatima(Rali Allahu
 Anha) was ready to go to the wedding. But the jews didn’t have a
good intention in their mind. They wanted to make fun
of the poor state of Fatima  when she arrived for the wedding. It was the day of the wedding. Fatima (Rali Allahu Anha) arrived
wearing a bright dazzling cloth.  It was sent to her by
Allah (Subhanahu wa ta'ala). When people looked at her,
some of them fell unconscious! Even the bride fainted, and there
was no sign her waking up. The mother of the bride begged
Fatima for her help. Fatima (Rali Allahu Anha)
 prayed two rakat namaz  and prayed to Allah to
restore the bride to life. As she finished her dua, the bride opened
her eyes and looked at Fatima. She stood up and shouted to everyone  “It is only because of her dua
that I got my life back!” She then recited “Ashadu an La Ilaha illa'llah 
Muhammadan Rasulullah” and she declared her faith in Islam! When the other guests witnessed this miracle,they too announced
their acceptance of Islam. Bibi Fatima led a simple life eating
simple food and wearing plainest clothes. Hazrat Ali  noted that
she had blisters on her arms after working on the grindstone for hours. Yet she never complained. She never asked or demanded for anything. One day Bibi Fatima  was ill,
and she was lying on bed. Ali (RA) went to her and asked her
 if he could get a fruit for her. But she kept quiet and
didn’t answer at first. When he repeated the question again, she said that it would be
nice to have a pomegranate. Ali was happy to hear this.  Finally his
wife had asked him for something. He went to the market and asked
a shopkeeper for pomegranates. But the seller said that pomegranates
were not of that season, and he didn’t have any stock. Ali went to another another shop,
but there too he was disappointed. One by one, he kept visiting different
shops searching for the fruit. And finally he got one, and he returned
 home to give the fruit to his wife. As he walked home, he heard a groan. Imam Ali went to see who
was making that sound. He found a poor beggar lying down. From the looks of it, he could see
that he was down with fever. “Are you ok” He asked the beggar.  “Can I help you” The beggar said
“I have been sick for many days. My mouth is so dry!  I wish someone could
give me a pomegranate. “ Ali was bewildered. He always loved helping others,  and he could easily give the pomegranate
in his hand to help the beggar. But his wife asked something of
him for the first time!  “What do I do” he thought. Finally, he broke the fruit in half,
and gave one half to the beggar. He then walked home. But after sometime,
he met another beggar on the road. This time he had to give the other
 half of the fruit to the beggar. Hazrat ali was sad, and walked back home. When he reached home, he was surprised. His wife was sitting outside the house,  with a basket full of
pomegranates in front of her! She said “There was a knock
on the door just now.  I came out and saw this whole
basket full of pomegranates!  Thank you for sending these!” As soon as he heard this, he realized that those fruits were
from Allah (Subhanahu wa ta'ala) Mashallah! That was such a great story I’m glad you liked it my son Are there any more stories of
Bibi Fatima (Rali Allahu Anha) uncle? Yes my son,  there are many  other interesting stories.  I will tell you those later. It is time for me to leave.  Good bye! Good bye!"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! How was your school today? It was good Uncle.
How was your work? It was fine Abu. So, have you finish your homework? Yes Uncle, I had finish that as soon as
I reached home. Very good Abu.
So, are you ready for today's story? Yes I am! Which story are you
going to tell me today? Inshallah, I will tell you the story of
Hazrat Fatima (Rali Allahu Anha) Bismillahirrahmanirrahim!  The story of
Hazrat Fatima (Rali Allahu Anha) By now Khadija was not doing very well.  Living in the desert for three long
years had taken a toll on her health.  She was sick by the time
they returned to Makkah. Fatima loved her mother very much
and she took great care of her. Little Fatima was only seven years old
when her mother fell sick She knew that her father loved
 her mother very much. His uncle, Abu Talib,
who was always kind to him,  had passed away just a month ago.
And now his wife was sick. Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha) knew that
she was going to die soon. She kept thinking about Fatima. She wept for her thinking about her
lonely life after she dies. Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha) passed
away on the tenth day of Ramadan. Fatima had lost her mother
at such a young age. The prophet had lost two most important
people in the last few months.  He declared that year as
‘the year of sorrow’. The Prophet continued calling people
to Islam, and the Quraysh were fed up. One night they came up with
a plan to kill the Prophet. They sent their men to kill
the Prophet during the night. When the men reached they saw that the
prophet was not alone inside the house. They knew that the prophet would come
out his house early in the morning. They decided to wait till next
morning to kill the Prophet. Prophet
Muhammad (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam)  realized the situation  and decided to
get out of Makakh that night. He asked Ali if he could sleep in his bed
to confuse the attackers. “If I sleep in the bed,
will it save your life?” asked Ali The Prophet replied yes,
and his nephew readily agreed. He slept in the bed in the
place of the Prophet,  and covered himself with
the green blanket. The attackers could see someone
sleeping covered in green blanket,  and they thought it must be the prophet. They decided to wait till dawn
to make their move. In the meantime, Prophet left his house,
and rode toward Medina. This was known as the first Hijrah and
marks the start of the Islamic calendar. When the enemies came into the
house the next morning  they were shocked to find Imam Ali (RA)
in the bed, instead of the Prophet. After a few days, Imam Ali (RA) took Bibi
Fatima and others and travelled to Medina. The Prophet who had already reached Medina,  was waiting for them outside the city. He was so happy to see his
 closed ones again. When Bibi Fatima reached the age of nine,  many men came forward asking
for her hand in marriage. Some of the men were rich and wealthy,
some were from noble families But the Prophet refused, and kept
waiting for the right man. One day, Imam Ali (RA) came to the Prophet
and asked if he would let him marry Fatima. The Prophet was happy at this proposal as
he knew Hazrat Ali was a good man.  He was a good muslim, and the prophet
knew him since he was a child. Once Ali left, He asked his daughter
 if she was willing to marry Hazrat Ali. She bowed her head in modesty
but she was happy. The Prophet stood up and said
“Allahu Akbar” He called Imam Ali (RA) and conveyed
 him the good news! On Friday, the first day of Zihil, in 2 AH, the wedding of Bibi Fatima (RA)
and Imam Ali (RA) was celebrated.  Prophet Muhammad (SAW) placed the hand
 of Fatima in Ali’s hand and said “May Allah bless his messengers daughter.  Ali, this is Fatima.
You are responsible for her. What an excellent wife Fatima is.
What an excellent husband Ali is. O Allah, bless them and their children” Bibi Fatima (RA) now began her
role as the wife of Ali (RA).  They led a simple life, and they loved
and respected each other.  Hazrat Ali would go out to do his work,
and Fatima did the chores inside the house. Ali would also gather firewood,
and buy goods for his house. They were happy to share their food and
 belongings with the poor and needy. No one ever returned empty
handed from their door. Allah blessed them with four children,
they were Imam Hasan (RA), Shaban,  Imam Hussain (RA), Hazrat Zainab (RA),
and their youngest one Umme Kulsoon Prophet appointed a maid Bibi Fizza to
 help Fatima with their household chore.  But the Prophet gave
them strict instructions. Bibi Fizza was allowed to
work on alternate days. Fatima used to do all the work
when Bibi Fizza was on leave. Prophet was very fond of his grandchildren
and named each of them himself.  He would often visit the house of
Fatima and played with the kids Mashallah! That was such a great story I’m glad you liked it my son There are many other interesting stories.  I will tell you those later. It is time for me to leave. Good bye! Good bye!"

"Assalmu Alaikum Uncle! Walaikum Assalam Abu! How was your school today? It was good uncle. How was your work? It was fine Abu. So, have you finished your homework? Yes, Uncle. I had finish that as soon as I reached home Very good Abu. So, are you ready for the story then? I'm uncle. I'm so glad that you are
 loving the stories Abu. Yes, Uncle! I just love this stories Inshallah! Uncle, Which story are you going
 to tell me today? Mm... I will tell you the story of
Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha) Please tell this story uncle. Alright! Now listen carefully Bismillahirrahmanirrahim! The Priests from different
tribes started publicly prosecuting the supporters of the Prophet. It was during this time that a
Christian king named Al Najashi was ruling Abyssinia. The prophet had heard about
the righteousness, tolerance and hospitality
 of this kind ruler. When the persecution became
 unbearable for the people, the Prophet advised them
to emigrate to Abyssinia. Some 15 families emigrated to this country,  in small groups to avoid detection.  This is called the first Hijrah
 in the history of Islam.  This happened during the fifth year
of the Prophet’s mission. The emigrants received a kind reception
from the king and his people. They were soon followed by many others, who suffered at the hands of
the evil Priests in Makkah. The number of people who emigrated
 soon reached hundred. When the priests heard about this,
they were furious! They decided not to leave
the emigrants in peace. They immediately sent two envoys to
the King, for bringing back all of them. When the envoys met the King, he summoned the poor fugitives and
asked them what they had to say Ja’far the son of Abu Talib, and brother of Ali then spoke
 for the exiles “O king! We were plunged in the depth of barbarism, we adored idols,  we disregarded everything, and we had no law.  Then Allah raised a man among us, who was pure and honest. He taught us to worship Allah, and forbade
us from worshipping the idols. He taught us to speak the
truth, and to be faithful.  We believe in Him, and we have
accepted His teachings. His followers were persecuted, forcing us to back into worship
 the idols again! When we found no safety in among them, we came to your kingdom trusting us
to save us from them"". When the King heard his speech, He asked the envoy to return to their land, and not to interfere with the emigrants. While His followers sought
refuge in foreign lands,  the Prophet continued his preaching
against strict opposition. Some of them mocked at Him, and they asked for a sign. Then the Prophet would say “Allah has not sent me to work wonders,  He has sent me to preach to you” But the Priests persisted
didn’t agree with Him. They insisted that unless they saw sign,  they would not believe in His Lord. The disbelievers used to ask “Why is He not showing any miracles
like the previous Prophets?” “Because miracles had proved inadequate
to convince” answered the prophet. “Noah was sent with signs,
then what happened? Where was the lost tribe of Thamud? They refused to believe in
 Prophet Salih(Alaihissalam) unless they showed a sign. Then the Prophet caused the rocks to break
and brought forth a living camel. He did what they asked for. Then what happened? In anger, the people cut the camel’s feet and again dared the Prophet to fulfill his threat of judgement.  Eventually they all lay dead in
their beds the next morning. There are some seventeen places in Quran,
in which the Prophet is challenged in which the Prophet is
to show a sign. But He gave all of them
the same answer After sometime, the priests
approached Abu Talib again, and asked him to abandon his nephew. But the honorable man declared his
intention to protect the Prophet against any harm. Certain events forced the Quraysh to lift
 the ban on the Muslims. The Prophet and his followers were allowed
to return to Makkah after three long years! In the following year, His uncle
Abu Talib passed away.  He was a great supporter of the
prophet for many years. He had grown very sick and weak, and he
died soon after returning to Makkah. Khadija’s health was not in
great shape either.  She had suffered great hardships. The food was scarce,
and instead of eating herself, she used to give all the food to
her children and husband. Once the richest woman in Makkah
spent her last few days as a poor. She passed away a few days after
Abu Talib’s death Prophet had lost his most loyal supporters.  He was heart broken. He could hardly manage to
keep his mind strong. He called that year the year of sorrow. Whenever he spoke of Khadija, he spoke of
her with great love and fondness. Khadija’slife is a source of
great inspiration to believers, especially women. Her story is a reminder to live
 a purposeful life. We should remember Khadija and
the whole family of Prophet  in our prayers for their
sacrifice and dedication. May Allah be pleased with them all! Thats all Abu. Next time I will tell you another story. Thanks,Massalam Yusuf uncle! May Allah bless you! Massalam Abu!! I will see you soon. Next time when I come here, I will tell you more stories. Sure Uncle, It was a really nice story Thanks a lot uncle! You are welcome my son. May Allah bless you!
Massalama! Maassalama  Uncle Yusuf!"
"Assalamu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! So are you ready for today's story? Yes I am! Which story are you
going to tell me today? Inshallah, I will tell you the
 story of Hazrat Fatima (Rali Allahu Anha) Bismillahirrahmanirrahim! The Story of
 Hazrat Fatima (Rali Allahu Anha) Hazrat Fatima (Rali Allahu Anha) was the daughter of Prophet
Muhammad (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam)  and Hazrat Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha).  She is a vital character in the religion  and considered a role model
 for all Muslim women. She was noble, kind, generous
and always truthful.  She was known by other names
such as Butool, Insiya, Azraa, Masumah, and many others. She was the wife of
Hazrat Imam Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu). Through her words and actions, she showed
the world how to live as a true Muslim. Bibi Fatima (Rali Allahu Anha)
was born on a Friday.  The holy prophet named her Fatima. Both the parents were very
happy when she was born. Bibi Fatima was looked after with great
care by the Prophet and his wife.  Islam was spreading those days, and many people now followed
the teachings of the Prophet. The enemies too grew by the day. The life had become very difficult
for the Prophet and his family. It had become a routine for
the enemies for Islam to throw garbage at the prophet,
whenever he passed by their house. One day, on top of throwing a
garbage at the prophet, they placed thorn in his path, and the prophet’s legs were bleeding. When Fatima saw her fathers bleeding leg,
she was sad. She washed the wound with water,
and cleaned his clothes. The Prophet had to face several hardships
while preaching Islam in Makkah.  The enemies, mostly comprised of the
Quraysh clan, belonged to the upper class.  They were scared that people
would not respect them  if they started following Islam. They arranged men to throw
stones at the prophet. But the Prophet continued to call people
to Allah (Subhanahu wa ta'ala ) patiently. When all the efforts of the Quraish failed, they decided to impose a ban
on Muslims in Makkah Abu Lahab, the uncle of the Prophet,
was also the leader of Quraysh in Makkah.  He was a very evil man,
and the worst enemy of Muslims. He ordered a complete ban on the
 Prophet’s family and their followers. No one in Makkah was allowed to
buy or sell anything to them. They were not even allowed to talk to them. It was very difficult in those
days for someone to live without the support of their tribe. For three long years, the Prophet labored
quietly to deliver the message of God. Idol worship was deeply
rooted among the people, and the Prophet tried to convince
as much as He could After three years of struggle, He was
only able to secure thirty followers! Even His companions had now
started questioning His sanity! By now His enemies had started
plotting against the Prophet The Prophet preached that everyone
 were equal in front of God, and this challenged the
authority of local priests! One day,
they gathered together and decided to suppress the movement of Prophet. They decided that each family
should take upon themselves the task of stamping out
the followers of Islam. They banned the muslims from
entering the city of Makkah The Prophet and his followers were
forced to leave the city of Makkah. They set up a camp just outside Makkah.  They made tents and lived in
 it for three long years. They were not allowed to enter the city to buy anything, neither could
they sell anything as well. Bibi Fatima witnessed the people
 living in extreme poverty Hazrat Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha)
spent most of her wealth  in buying necessary goods
to help the Muslims. But she had to pay a high
price for the goods  as no one was willing to
sell anything to them. Their only support was the Prophet's
uncle- Hazrat Abu Talib,  the father of Hazrat Imam ali. He refused to give up on his nephew. In spite of all this, Prophet
continued his preaching.  As days went by more and more
 people were joining Islam. When the Quraysh realized that,  banning the Muslims was not going
to be of any help at all. So they lifted the ban, and Muslims
were allowed to return to Makkah. By now Khadija was not doing very well. Living in the desert for three long years
had taken a toll on her health. She was sick by the time
they returned to Makkah. Fatima loved her mother very much
and she took great care of her. Little Fatima was only seven years old
when her mother fell sick She knew that her father loved
her mother very much. His uncle, Abu Talib,
who was always kind to him, had passed away just a month ago. And now his wife was sick. Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha) knew
that she was going to die soon. She kept thinking about Fatima. She wept for her thinking about
her lonely life after she dies. Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha) passed away
on the tenth day of Ramadan. Fatima had lost her mother
at such a young age. The prophet had lost two most important
 people in the last few months. He declared that year as
‘the year of sorrow’. By now Khadija was not doing very well.  Living in the desert for three long

and Imam Ali (RA) was celebrated.  Prophet Muhammad (SAW) placed the hand
 of Fatima in Ali’s hand and said “May Allah bless his messengers daughter.  Ali, this is Fatima.
You are responsible for her. What an excellent wife Fatima is.
What an excellent husband Ali is. O Allah, bless them and their children” Bibi Fatima (RA) now began her
role as the wife of Ali (RA).  They led a simple life, and they loved
and respected each other.  Hazrat Ali would go out to do his work,
and Fatima did the chores inside the house. Ali would also gather firewood,
and buy goods for his house. They were happy to share their food and

they were Imam Hasan (RA), Shaban,  Imam Hussain (RA), Hazrat Zainab (RA),
and their youngest one Umme Kulsoon Prophet appointed a maid Bibi Fizza to

them strict instructions. Bibi Fizza was allowed to
work on alternate days. Fatima used to do all the work
when Bibi Fizza was on leave. Prophet was very fond of his grandchildren
and named each of them himself.  He would often visit the house of
Fatima and played with the kids One day Prophet
 Muhammad (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam)  came to her house, said salaams to her. Fatima returned his greetings Prophet asked her to cover him with the
Yemeni blanket as He was feeling weak. Fatima did like He asked Her,
and covered Him with the blanket. She noticed that Her father’s face
was shining like a moon! Some time later, Her son
 Hasan (RA) came and salaams.  He could smell the fragrance
 of his grandfather and asked his mother if he was here. Fatima returned his salaams and told him
that his grandfather was inside the blanket Al-Hasan moved towards the cloak and said,  ""Peace be upon you, O grandfather. Will you allow me to be with
you under this cloak?"" Prophet replied, ""Peace be upon you too, my son and
director of my Pond. I allow you."" Al-Hasan then went under the
 cloak with his grandfather Shortly afterward he son
Al-Hussain came in, ""Peace be upon you, mother!"" he greeted. ""Peace be upon you, too” she replied. ""O mother,"" he said, ""I can smell a
 pleasing scent of my grandfather."" ""Yes, it is,"" I answered, ""Your grandfather
 and your brother are now under the cloak."" Al-Hussain moved towards
the cloak and said, ""Peace be upon you, O grandfather. Will you allow me to be with
you under this cloak?"" Prophet replied, ""Peace be upon you too,
my son. I allow you.""  Al-Hussain then went under the cloak
with his grandfather. At the same time, Hazrat Ali came in,
""Peace be upon you” he greeted Fatima ""Peace be upon you too"" she replied. He then said, ""Fatimah,
 I can smell a pleasing scent, as if it is the scent of my brother and
cousin the Messenger of Allah."" ""Yes,"" she answered, ""He is there with
your two sons under the cloak."" Ali moved towards the cloak and said,
""Peace be upon you, O Allah’s Messenger! Will you allow me to be with
you under the cloak?"" Prophet replied,
""Peace be upon you too. I allow you."" Ali thus went with them under the cloak. Fatima then said,
""Peace be upon you father, Will you allow me to be
with you under the cloak?"" ""Peace be upon you too, my daughter
 and part of my flesh. I allow you.""  This way Fatima too went
with them under the cloak. When all of them were together
underneath the cloak, the Prophet held the two ends
 of the cloak and raised  his right hand towards the
 heavens and prayed “O Allah, these are the people of my
household, the Ahl-ul Bayt. They are of my flesh and blood. Whoever
makes them unhappy, makes me unhappy. They are from me and I am from them. Send your blessings and
mercy on me and them.  Repel all blemishes from them
and keep them pure as pure.” Allah then spoke to His angels and said he had created the whole of the
universe for the love of the five who were under the cloak. Angel Jibraeel asked
who was under the cloak. Allah replied that they are the
household of the Messenger. Jibrael was then sent to
the house of Fatima. After getting the permission of
the Prophet, he entered the cloak. Angel then told them what Allah had said
and recited the Ayat e Tatheer sent by Allah in praise of the Ahlal Bayt. Hadees e Kisa brings many benefits.  One’s sins will be forgiven,
and his hurdles will be resolved. The Hadees e Kisa shows that
Bibi Fatima (RA) is the  link between the
 Prophet and the Imams. She is the centre of Purity
and the Panjatan e Paak. One must recite this hadees
atleast once a week. One day, a rich jew came to the
Prophet’s house for  inviting Fatima to his daughters wedding. The Prophet told them that he will ask
his daughter and inform them. He told Fatima about the invitation, and she said she will seek the
 permission of her husband. Hazrat Ali (Rali Allahu Anhu)
gave his approval and Fatima(Rali Allahu Anha) was
 ready to go to the wedding. But the jews didn’t have a
good intention in their mind. They wanted to make fun
of the poor state of Fatima  when she arrived for the wedding. It was the day of the wedding. Fatima (Rali Allahu Anha) arrived
wearing a bright dazzling cloth.  It was sent to her by
Allah (Subhanahu wa ta'ala). When people looked at her,
some of them fell unconscious! Even the bride fainted, and there
was no sign her waking up. The mother of the bride begged
Fatima for her help. Fatima (Rali Allahu Anha)
 prayed two rakat namaz  and prayed to Allah to
restore the bride to life. As she finished her dua, the bride opened
her eyes and looked at Fatima. She stood up and shouted to everyone  “It is only because of her dua
that I got my life back!” She then recited “Ashadu an La Illaha
illAllah Muhammadan Rasulullah” and she declared her faith in Islam! When the other guests witnessed this miracle,they too announced
their acceptance of Islam. Bibi Fatima (RA) led a simple life eating
simple food and wearing plainest clothes. Hazrat Ali (RA) noted that
she had blisters on her arms after working on the grindstone for hours.
Yet she never complained. She never asked or demanded for anything. One day Bibi Fatima (RA) was ill,
and she was lying on bed. Ali (RA) went to her and asked her
 if he could get a fruit for her. But she kept quiet and
didn’t answer at first. When he repeated the question again, she said that it would be
nice to have a pomegranate. Ali was happy to hear this. Finally his
wife had asked him for something. He went to the market and asked
a shopkeeper for pomegrenates. But the seller said that pomegranates
were not of that season, and he didn’t have any stock. Ali went to another another shop,
but there too he was disappointed. One by one, he kept visiting different
shops searching for the fruit. And finally he got one, and he returned
 home to give the fruit to his wife. As he walked home, he heard a groan. Imam Ali went to see who
was making that sound. He found a poor beggar lying down. From the looks of it, he could see
that he was down with fever. “Are you ok” He asked the beggar.
 “Can I help you” The beggar said
“I have been sick for many days. My mouth is so dry! I wish someone could
give me a pomegranate. “ Ali was bewildered.
He always loved helping others,  and he could easily give the pomegranate
in his hand to help the beggar. But his wife asked something of
him for the first time!  “What do I do” he thought. Finally, he broke the fruit in half,
and gave one half to the beggar. He then walked home. But after sometime,
he met another beggar on the road. This time he had to give the other
 half of the fruit to the beggar. Hazrat ali was sad, and walked back home. When he reached home, he was surprised. His wife was sitting outside the house,  with a basket full of
pomegranates in front of her! She said “There was a knock
on the door just now.  I came out and saw this whole
basket full of pomegranates!  Thank you for sending these!” As soon as he heard this, he realized that those fruits were
from Allah (Subhanahu wa ta'ala) Mashallah! That was such a great story I’m glad you liked it my son Are there any more stories of
Bibi Fatima (Rali Allahu Anha) uncle? Yes my son, there are many
 other interesting stories.  I will tell you those later. It is time for me to leave.
 Good bye! Good bye!"
"Assalmu Alaikum! Walaikum Assalam! So are you ready for todays story? Yes I am! Which story are you 
going to tell me today? Inshallah, I will tell you the

care by the Prophet and his wife.  Islam was spreading those days, and many people now followed 
the teachings of the Prophet. The enemies too grew by the day. The life had become very difficult 
for the Prophet and his family. It had become a routine for 
the enemies for Islam to throw garbage at the prophet, 
whenever he passed by their house. One day, on top of throwing 
garbage at the prophet, they placed thorns in his path, and the prophet’s legs were bleeding. When Fatima saw her fathers bleeding leg, 
she was sad. She washed the wound with water, 
and cleaned his clothes. The Prophet had to face several hardships 
while preaching Islam in Makkah.  The enemies, mostly comprised of the 
Quraysh clan, belonged to the upper class.  They were scared that people 
would not respect them  if they started following Islam. They arranged men to throw 
stones at the prophet. But the Prophet continued to call people 
to Allah (Subhanahu wa ta'ala ) patiently. When all the efforts of the Quraish failed, they decided to impose a ban 
on Muslims in Makkah Abu Lahab, the uncle of the Prophet, 
was also the leader of Quraysh in Makkah.  He was a very evil man, 
and the worst enemy of Muslims. He ordered a complete ban on the
 Prophet’s family and their followers. No one in Makkah was allowed to 
buy or sell anything to them. They were not even allowed to talk to them. It was very difficult in those 
days for someone to live without the support of their tribe. For three long years, the Prophet labored 
quietly to deliver the message of God. Idol worship was deeply 
rooted among the people, and the Prophet tried to convince 
as much as He could After three years of struggle, He was 
only able to secure thirty followers! Even His companions had now 
started questioning His sanity! By now His enemies had started 
plotting against the Prophet The Prophet preached that everyone
 were equal in front of God, and this challenged the 
authority of local priests! One day, 
they gathered together and decided to suppress the movement of Prophet. They decided that each family 
should take upon themselves the task of stamping out 
the followers of Islam. They banned the muslims from 
entering the city of Makkah The Prophet and his followers were 
forced to leave the city of Makkah. They set up a camp just outside Makkah.  They made tents and lived in
 it for three long years. They were not allowed to enter the city to buy anything, neither could 
they sell anything as well. Bibi Fatima witnessed the people
 living in extreme poverty Hazrat Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha) 
spent most of her wealth  in buying necessary goods 
to help the Muslims. But she had to pay a high 
price for the goods  as no one was willing to 
sell anything to them. Their only support was the Prophet 
uncle- Hazrat Abu Talib (as),  the father of Hazrat Imam ali (as). He refused to give up on his nephew. In spite of all this, Prophet 
continued his preaching.  As days went by more and more
 people were joining Islam. When the Quraysh realized that,  banning the Muslims was not going 
to be of any help at all. So they lifted the ban, and Muslims 
were allowed to return to Makkah. By now Khadija was not doing very well. Living in the desert for three long years 
had taken a toll on her health. She was sick by the time 
they returned to Makkah. Fatima loved her mother very much 
and she took great care of her. Little Fatima was only seven years old 
when her mother fell sick She knew that her father loved 
her mother very much. His uncle, Abu Talib, 
who was always kind to him, had passed away just a month ago. And now his wife was sick. Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha) knew 
that she was going to die soon. She kept thinking about Fatima. She wept for her thinking about 
her lonely life after she dies. Khadija (Rali Allahu Anha) passed away 
on the tenth day of Ramadan. Fatima had lost her mother 
at such a young age. The prophet had lost two most important
 people in the last few months. He declared that year as 
‘the year of sorrow’. Mashallah! That was such a great story I’m glad you liked it my son There are many other interesting stories.
 I will tell you those later. It is time for me to leave. 
Good bye! Good bye!"

"EP 12: Peace in United Jerusalem&nbsp; So far, the Battle of Yarmouk helped the&nbsp;
Muslims spread Islam peacefully in Syria,&nbsp;&nbsp; Lebanon, and Jordan. Now there&nbsp;
were two major places that were&nbsp;&nbsp; left - Egypt and Palestine. Since Palestine&nbsp;
was closer, they decided to go there first,&nbsp;&nbsp; specifically Jerusalem. At that point, the Muslims&nbsp;
were very strong, and the people of Jerusalem&nbsp;&nbsp; already liked Islam. But the Roman soldiers and&nbsp;
some Christian leaders did not like the Muslims.&nbsp;&nbsp; Caliph Umar (r) ordered the Muslim army not to&nbsp;
have any war in that holy land. Muslims very much&nbsp;&nbsp; respected Jerusalem as their holy land, because&nbsp;
Allah (SWT) sent many, many prophets in that land.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the Muslims' first prayer direction&nbsp;
was to Jerusalem. Prophet Muhammad&nbsp;&nbsp; (s) was taken to the 7th sky during the&nbsp;
night of the Miraj from this holy land.&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to have a peaceful agreement with&nbsp;
the Christian Roman soldiers of Jerusalem,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Muslims were waiting around 4 months&nbsp;
outside the town. It was hard for the Muslims,&nbsp;&nbsp; but still, they decided not to attack the&nbsp;
holy land because Islam always wants peace.&nbsp; The leader of Jerusalem became very surprised&nbsp;
to see the Muslim’s kindness to the Christian&nbsp;&nbsp; people. They started to think that King&nbsp;
Heraclius was the one that was very bad.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was the one who forced the poor people&nbsp;
to pay high taxes and did not give them any&nbsp;&nbsp; freedom of religion. They were thinking that God&nbsp;
was picking the Muslims to rule this holy land.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the leaders of Jerusalem were ready to&nbsp;
make a peace agreement with the Muslims.&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, the commanders in chiefs are the&nbsp;
ones who usually sign peace agreements. But&nbsp;&nbsp; they wanted Caliph Umar (r) to sign the&nbsp;
peace agreement and give him the key&nbsp;&nbsp; to this holy land. Right away, commander in&nbsp;
chief Abu Ubaidah sent a letter to Medina.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of Umar's (r) advisors told him not to go to&nbsp;
Jerusalem. Ali (r) was very smart and intelligent,&nbsp;&nbsp; and he advised Umar (r) to go to Jerusalem&nbsp;
because that was a holy land for all Muslims,&nbsp;&nbsp; Christians, and even Jews. If the caliph goes&nbsp;
there, the different religious people would feel&nbsp;&nbsp; safe. They would know that the caliph was on their&nbsp;
side even though they follow a different religion.&nbsp; Umar (r) liked Ali (r)'s advice and started&nbsp;
his journey to the holy city of Jerusalem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though by this time the Muslims became&nbsp;
very powerful, Umar (r) traveled in an extremely&nbsp;&nbsp; simple way. For his journey, the caliph of&nbsp;
Islam only took a camel, some barley for food,&nbsp;&nbsp; a wooden cup, and a servant. The journey&nbsp;
from Medina to Jerusalem was very long.&nbsp;&nbsp; Umar (r) was on top of the camel but when he&nbsp;
realized that his servant was getting tired from&nbsp;&nbsp; walking in the hot desert sun, immediately Caliph&nbsp;
Umar (r) got down from the camel and told the&nbsp;&nbsp; servant to ride on the camel instead. The servant&nbsp;
was shocked to see how the caliph of Islam, or the&nbsp;&nbsp; king of Muslim Ummah, was giving such respect to&nbsp;
a servant. During their entire journey, Umar (r)&nbsp;&nbsp; and the servant took turns riding the camel. When&nbsp;
they were close to Jerusalem, it was the servant's&nbsp;&nbsp; turn to ride the camel. The servant felt really&nbsp;
bad and requested Umar (r) to ride the camel.&nbsp;&nbsp; But Caliph Umar (r) said it was the servant's&nbsp;
turn, so the servant should ride the camel.&nbsp;&nbsp; The people of Jerusalem and the Christian leaders&nbsp;
were waiting to welcome the most powerful Muslim&nbsp;&nbsp; leader or king. They saw two people were coming,&nbsp;
one was walking, and another was riding a camel.&nbsp;&nbsp; They thought the servant was the Caliph. When&nbsp;
Muslim commanders Abu Ubaidah and Khalid bin&nbsp;&nbsp; Walid were showing respect to the person who was&nbsp;
walking, the people of Jerusalem were confused.&nbsp;&nbsp; They could not recognize the&nbsp;
Muslims' most powerful leader.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were surprised to see how a leader or the&nbsp;
king had such simple clothes and best behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were really happy to have such a leader.&nbsp;
Outside of the city, Umar (r) signed the peace&nbsp;&nbsp; agreement. He promised the people of Jerusalem&nbsp;
that they could live peacefully and safely.&nbsp;&nbsp; They would have the freedom of religion, keep&nbsp;
their lands, keep their churches, and all of&nbsp;&nbsp; their religious items were safe. Finally, in the&nbsp;
year 637, Caliph Umar (r) entered the holy city&nbsp;&nbsp; of Jerusalem. The Christian leader or priest&nbsp;
welcomed and gave him the key to Jerusalem. When&nbsp;&nbsp; the Christian leader saw Umar (r)'s simple clothes&nbsp;
and politeness, he understood the greatness of the&nbsp;&nbsp; Muslim leader and gave him the highest level of&nbsp;
respect. He showed Umar (r) all around the city&nbsp;&nbsp; and took him to their holy Church. The Christian&nbsp;
leader offered him to pray in their Church.&nbsp;&nbsp; Umar (r) thought if he prayed inside&nbsp;
the holy Church, many years later,&nbsp;&nbsp; some Muslims might break the peace agreement&nbsp;
and take away the Church from the Christians.&nbsp; So, to protect the Christian holy place, he did&nbsp;
not pray there but still respected the place&nbsp;&nbsp; very much. The Christian leader was shocked&nbsp;
at the Muslims’ kindness and understood the&nbsp;&nbsp; situation. He then took Umar (r) to the famous&nbsp;
place, the Bait-ul-Muqaddas, which was the&nbsp;&nbsp; direction where the Muslims used to pray during&nbsp;
the beginning of Islam. But unfortunately, it was&nbsp;&nbsp; ruined by the Roman soldiers because remember,&nbsp;
they did not have the freedom of religion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that place, the Muslims became very&nbsp;
sad. Umar (r) started to pick up the rocks&nbsp;&nbsp; and clean the place. The Christian leader was&nbsp;
shocked again to see the leader of the Muslim&nbsp;&nbsp; world picking up the pieces and cleaning the area.&nbsp;
In a short time, the Muslims cleaned the place and&nbsp;&nbsp; called the Athan for prayer. The Muslims' eyes&nbsp;
were filled with tears of joy and happiness and&nbsp;&nbsp; thanked Allah (SWT) in their prayer. After&nbsp;
all, this was the 3rd most Islamic holy place.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first one is Makkah where the Kabbah is, the&nbsp;
second is Medina, where the prophet’s mosque is,&nbsp;&nbsp; and this was the third&nbsp;
place, the Bait-ul-Muqaddas.&nbsp; For many years only Christians were allowed&nbsp;
to live in Jerusalem. But after the Muslims&nbsp;&nbsp; were in control of Jerusalem, Umar (r)&nbsp;
allowed everyone, the Muslims, Christians,&nbsp;&nbsp; and the Jews to live in that place and practice&nbsp;
their own religion. It was a very emotional day&nbsp;&nbsp; for the Jews because, for almost 500 years, the&nbsp;
Christians were very cruel and bad to the Jews.&nbsp;&nbsp; But under the Muslims' rule, the Jews&nbsp;
finally were able to live peacefully&nbsp;&nbsp; and practice their religion in Jerusalem.&nbsp;
Alhamdulilah, under Caliph Umar (r),&nbsp;&nbsp; the Muslims, Christians, and the Jews lived&nbsp;
peacefully together in Jerusalem, the holy city."
"Muslims Without a Leader From the very beginning, Allah (SWT) sent&nbsp;
many, many prophets in our world so that they&nbsp;&nbsp; could teach us how to be good and follow Allah&nbsp;
(SWT)’s orders. Before the Prophet Muhammad (s)&nbsp;&nbsp; all of the prophets told only their people about&nbsp;
Allah’s law and order. But when our last prophet&nbsp;&nbsp; Muhammad (s) came, he didn’t come only for the&nbsp;
Arabian people. He came to guide the whole world&nbsp;&nbsp; to follow Allah (SWT)’s last book, the Quran.&nbsp;
When his job in this world was finished, Prophet&nbsp;&nbsp; Muhammad (s) took his last breath in this world.
It was the 12th of Rabi' Al-Awwal, of the 11th&nbsp;&nbsp; Hijri, or on Monday, June 8, in the year 632. The&nbsp;
Muslims were very sad and heartbroken when they&nbsp;&nbsp; heard the news that the prophet Muhammad&nbsp;
(s) was gone forever from this world.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Muslims that was the saddest&nbsp;
day in their entire lifetime. As&nbsp;&nbsp; soon as the prophet’s close friend, Abu Bakr (r)&nbsp;
heard the depressing news, he started to cry.&nbsp;&nbsp; He immediately went to the prophet and&nbsp;
kissed the prophet's forehead out of respect.&nbsp;&nbsp; After he calmed down, he went to the mosque to&nbsp;
give other Muslims mental support. Many Muslims&nbsp;&nbsp; could not believe that the Prophet Muhammad&nbsp;
(s) had truly passed away. Even Umar (r)&nbsp;&nbsp; could not believe that the Prophet had died. Then&nbsp;
Abu Bakr (r) got up in front of all the people&nbsp;&nbsp; and told the Muslims about Surah Imran&nbsp;
verse 144, where Allah (SWT) specifically&nbsp;&nbsp; said that Muhammad (s) was a prophet and just&nbsp;
only a human. So, he had to pass away just like&nbsp;&nbsp; all of the other prophets that came before him.&nbsp;
But only Allah (SWT) will never ever die and&nbsp;&nbsp; that’s why we should always follow Allah (SWT)’s&nbsp;
law and order every single moment. Then all the&nbsp;&nbsp; Muslims realized that the prophet Muhammad (s)&nbsp;
really did pass away, but they weren’t alone&nbsp;&nbsp; because Allah (SWT) would always be with them.
During this sad time, the Muslims were thinking,&nbsp;&nbsp; the prophet (s) was the leader for all the&nbsp;
Muslims, but after his death who would be their&nbsp;&nbsp; leader and how could Islam exist without a leader.&nbsp;
Who would collect and distribute zakat, or what&nbsp;&nbsp; would they do if anyone attacked Medina, or what&nbsp;
would they do if someone doesn't follow the Quran.&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to understand one thing. At that&nbsp;
time there was only the Quran. There were no&nbsp;&nbsp; Hadith books. Like today we have Bukhari or other&nbsp;
hadith books. So, the Muslims needed a new leader&nbsp;&nbsp; to lead the Muslim ummah. So, in that situation,&nbsp;
every tribe in Arabia including the good Muslims&nbsp;&nbsp; were trying to take the leadership position,&nbsp;
because that was a lifetime opportunity. 
 &nbsp; Unfortunately, some of the Ansar, the Medina’s&nbsp;
Muslims met in one place and talked about how&nbsp;&nbsp; they wanted someone from their tribes to be the&nbsp;
next Muslim leader. But the Ansar had two groups,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Aus tribe, and the Khazraj tribe. Before Islam&nbsp;
came, they were enemies and did not like each&nbsp;&nbsp; other. At that time even though there were only&nbsp;
a few Muhajirin, the Makkah’s Muslims in Medina,&nbsp;&nbsp; they were powerful and in charge of taking care of&nbsp;
many different things. So, the Ansar had an idea&nbsp;&nbsp; to have two leaders. One leader would be a&nbsp;
Muhajirin and the other would be an Ansar. They&nbsp;&nbsp; decided if the Muhajirin did not like the idea,&nbsp;
then the Ansar would kick the Makkah’s Muslims&nbsp;&nbsp; out from Medina and would be ready to fight&nbsp;
against them. In that meeting, the evil Shaytan&nbsp;&nbsp; tried to break the Muslims' unity and friendship.&nbsp;
A very big angry argument started to happen,&nbsp;&nbsp; between the Muslim Ummah. Right away one of the&nbsp;
sahabas went to Abu Bakr (r) to solve the problem.&nbsp; Abu Bakr (r) was very smart and intelligent.&nbsp;
Whenever there was a problem, people would come&nbsp;&nbsp; to him to solve their problems. At that moment,&nbsp;
Abu Bakr (r) was getting ready for the prophet’s&nbsp;&nbsp; burial preparations, but the people begged him to&nbsp;
come and solve the big chaos in order to protect&nbsp;&nbsp; Islam. Then Ali (r) was in charge of taking&nbsp;
care of the prophet’s funeral preparations.&nbsp; At that moment, it was very important for someone&nbsp;
to take control of the situation to keep the&nbsp;&nbsp; Muslim's unity because the Muslims' unity was&nbsp;
the prophet’s entire life of hard work. Bringing&nbsp;&nbsp; together Muslims from many different backgrounds&nbsp;
and to live in peace and harmony. The problem was&nbsp;&nbsp; that Prophet Muhammad (saw) didn’t even tell his&nbsp;
people directly who their next leader would be.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Prophet gave some clues and hints to his&nbsp;
people, so they would know who was going to be&nbsp;&nbsp; the next ruler. Muhammad(s) said that the&nbsp;
next leader should be from the Muhajirin,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Mecca's Muslims. Another clue was that when&nbsp;
the prophet was sick, he chose the great Abu Bakr&nbsp;&nbsp; (r) to lead the prayers. In total Abu Bakr led&nbsp;
the prayers 17 times when the prophet was sick.&nbsp; In that huge argument, Abu Bakr (r) tried&nbsp;
to calm everyone down and reminded the&nbsp;&nbsp; people that the prophet himself said the&nbsp;
next leader should be from the Muhajirin&nbsp;&nbsp; and the Ansar should be their helper and advisor.&nbsp;
When they remembered the prophet’s advice,&nbsp;&nbsp; they all realized their mistake. To solve&nbsp;
the problem Abu Bakr (r) told the people&nbsp;&nbsp; to choose their leader from two of the great&nbsp;
Quraysh Muslims, Umar or Abu Ubaidah (r)&nbsp;&nbsp; because they were with him at that moment.&nbsp;
Immediately Umar (r) refused, saying that&nbsp;&nbsp; Abu Bakr (r) should be the next leader because&nbsp;
he was the best Muhajirin and one of the best&nbsp;&nbsp; Muslims. When Abu Bakr was just a little boy&nbsp;
his father told him to worship the idols at the&nbsp;&nbsp; Kabbah. But little Abu Bakr knew the idols could&nbsp;
not hear him or speak. He then took a rock and&nbsp;&nbsp; threw it and the idol that broke into pieces.&nbsp;
He knew for sure that was not god, because&nbsp;&nbsp; idols can’t even protect themselves. So, from a&nbsp;
young age, Abu Bakr never worshipped the idols&nbsp;&nbsp; and believed in only one God, Allah (SWT). Abu&nbsp;
Bakr was only 2 years younger than the prophet,&nbsp;&nbsp; and the two little boys soon became best friends&nbsp;
following the path of Allah their whole life.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when Makkah was filled with evil, Abu Bakr&nbsp;
spread kindness and helped the weak and the poor&nbsp;&nbsp; and that’s why the people loved him. He was one of&nbsp;
the first people to believe in the prophet and was&nbsp;&nbsp; always ready to sacrifice everything for Islam.&nbsp;
He was with the prophet in the cave when escaping&nbsp;&nbsp; from Makkah. He was with the prophet from the very&nbsp;
beginning and the end. During the prophet’s last&nbsp;&nbsp; days on earth, the only person that the prophet&nbsp;
picked to lead the prayers was, Abu Bakr (r). And&nbsp;&nbsp; prayer is the highest level of Iman. When&nbsp;
the people remembered that Abu Bakr was truly&nbsp;&nbsp; one of the best Muslims amongst themselves,&nbsp;
everyone became very happy and easily accepted&nbsp;&nbsp; Abu Bakr (r) as their new leader. Soon the news&nbsp;
spread, and all of the Muslims rushed to see&nbsp;&nbsp; and accept him as the new Muslim leader.
On that Monday, the Muslims couldn’t get&nbsp;&nbsp; the Prophet’s funeral ready. So, the next day,&nbsp;
on Tuesday morning Abbas and Ali (r) and a few&nbsp;&nbsp; other Muslims helped wash the Prophet’s body. But&nbsp;
no one had any idea where the Prophet’s graveyard&nbsp;&nbsp; would be. Abu Bakr (r) then said that before&nbsp;
all of the other Prophets were buried where they&nbsp;&nbsp; passed away. So, the Muslims moved the Prophet’s&nbsp;
bed and started to dig his grave at that place.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no Imam for the Janaza prayer, but every&nbsp;
ten Muslims went into the room and prayed for the&nbsp;&nbsp; Prophet. Group by group, first all the Muslim&nbsp;
men prayed their Janaza prayer. Then all the&nbsp;&nbsp; women prayed their Janaza prayer. And finally,&nbsp;
all the children prayed their Janaza prayer for&nbsp;&nbsp; the prophet. It took the whole day for everyone to&nbsp;
finish the Janaza prayer. Finally, at the end of&nbsp;&nbsp; the day, on Tuesday night Prophet Muhammad (s) was&nbsp;
buried at his house where he took his last breath."
"Episode 9: Umar (r)'s Administration After the first Caliph Abu Bakr (r) death, Umar ibn al-Khattab (r) became the second
Caliph of Islam. Caliph Umar (r) was one of the big leaders
of the Quraysh tribe. Before Islam came, there were very few people
who could read and write. Umar (r) was one of those people. From his childhood, he was a very hard worker
and a very good judge. He knew what was right and what was wrong. He always spread fairness and justice wherever
he went. This is why the prophet Muhammad (s) gave
him a beautiful title, Al-Farooq. Which means the one who can tell what is right
and wrong. After Umar (r) became the new Caliph, he realized
that he needed to change somethings to manage the government because, with help of Allah
(SWT), the Muslim empire was growing bigger and bigger. When a place became part of the Muslim empire,
usually their tribe leaders ruled the lands. But each tribe was different from one another. So, the Muslim laws were slowly starting to
change from one tribe to another. To protect the unity of the Muslim ummah,
Caliph Umar (r) chose some good talented people to be governors of different areas. They would work under the Caliph. They would spread the same message and have
the same laws for the people. So, all around the Muslim empire, everyone
would follow Islam in the same exact way. Umar (r) also made changes to some army setups
to make Islam stronger. As we know, with the help of Allah (SWT),
the great commander in chief Khalid bin Walid never lost a single battle in his life as
a miracle. This was really good for the Muslims. But the people started to depend on Khalid
(r). They started to believe that Islam was spreading
just because of Khalid (r) and that, was really bad. As Muslims, we should put our faith in Allah
(SWT) and always depend on him and no one else. We have to believe that all success comes
from Allah (SWT). So, to protect the people from going to the
wrong path, the new Caliph Umar bin Al-Khattab (r) made a strong decision. He made Abu Ubaidah (r) the new commander
in chief, and said that no matter who is the commander in chief, it is Allah who gives
victory on the battlefield. Hearing that the Muslims understood their
mistake, and happily accepted Abu Ubaidah as their new commander in chief. They were doing very well on the Syrian Roman
side. They were trying to spread Islam and protect
the people from evil rulers. But on the Persian side, the Muslims were
facing problems. As we mentioned before, the Persian King Yazdegerd
III was only a 10-year-old little boy. His army general was Rostam. Basically, he ruled the country for the little
king. Rostam was very mad because lots of Persian
people were accepting the peaceful religion of Islam. Even their own people were leaving the Persian
army to join the Muslims instead. So, one after another, the Persians kept attacking
the border tribes' Muslims. One time, Rostam built a strong army with
lots of elephants and decided to destroy the border town Muslims. At that place, Muthanna (r) was in charge
of a small Muslim army. Right away, he sent the message to the new
Caliph Umar (r) at Medina. Umar (r) quickly sent some soldiers. Both armies met next to the Euphrates River,
present-day at Kufa, Iraq. At that battle, the Muslims had to cross the
Euphrates River with a small bridge. That is why the battle was known as the Battle
of Bridge. In this battle, the Persians brought their
tall and big elephants. The Muslims' horses got scared seeing the
big elephants for the first time. It was very difficult to control the situation. Unfortunately, the Muslims lost the battle,
and almost all the top generals were destroyed. Only the great Muslim general Muthanna (r)
and a few thousand Muslim soldiers were saved. In the Battle of the Bridge, almost 10,000
Muslim soldiers became martyrs and passed away. This was the first battle that the Muslims
lost against the big Persian army. The few soldiers who were alive were badly
hurt, but with the help of Allah (SWT), the Persians did not come after them. Instead, they had to quickly go back to their
capital because there were civil wars about leadership problems in their Persian empire. With Allah (SWT)'s blessing, the Muslims did
not give up easily. Very soon, they would win against the Persian
army."
"Episode 10: Battle of Yarmouk &amp; Muslim Women When the Persian empire got busy with their government leadership problems, that gave
the Muslims time to focus on the Roman enemies who wanted to have a really big war on the
other side. After the Muslims finally got control of Damascus,
this shocked the Romans because they thought the Muslims were weak. This victory was also very important for Muslims
to spread the message of Islam. Abu Sufyan's two sons, general Uncle Yazid
and Mu'awiyah both were in charge to protect Damascus. Commander in Chief Abu Ubaidah and the second
in command, Khalid bin Walid went far north to spread the message of Islam peacefully
to the people. The general people were accepting this beautiful
religion, Islam, and accepted Allah (SWT) as their only God. They successfully spread Islam up to present-day
Aleppo, Syria. At that time, the Roman capital was in Istanbul,
Turkey. The Christian Roman king did not like that
the true religion, Islam was spreading. So, he started to send different small armies
to attack the innocent Muslims. During the night, when the Muslims were sleeping,
they suddenly attacked the innocent Muslims and destroyed the Muslim men, women, and children. But the Muslims were still spreading Islam
peacefully. When the Christian King Heraclius realized
that nothing could stop the Muslims from spreading Islam, then he made a different plan. First, to become stronger, he made a friendship
with his very long-time enemy, Persia. So, Heraclius' granddaughter and the 10-year-old
Persian King, Yazdegerd III, got married. At that time, the Persian Capital was next
to Baghdad, Iraq. Then the Christian King Heraclius built a
very big army with more than 200,000 soldiers to destroy the Muslims and control all of
Arabia. After hearing that bad news, Abu Ubaidah and
Khalid bin Walid decided to get together all their strong people in one place to protect
Islam. Even to save the general people, they decided
to move out from the very important place Damascus. All the Muslims who were spreading Islam peacefully
in Palestine and Northern and Central Syria started to get together in an open place next
to the Yarmouk River at Jordan close to the sea of Galilee. Do you remember the Jewish tribe Banu Nadir? For details, you can see our Muhammad (s)'
story in episode 29. In short, around 10 years before, they planned
to kill the prophet Muhammad (s), and because of this, and many other bad actions, they
were kicked out from Medina. After they left, they started to live near
the Yarmouk River. That area was under the Roman Empire. The Christian King Heraclius did not let the
Jews follow their religion and forced them to be Christians. The Roman Christian soldiers gave the Jewish
people a very hard time. The Jews realized that the Muslim law was
really good and beautiful. Islam protected all the people's freedom and
safety. When the Jews heard about the big fight, right
away, the Jews were on the Muslims’ side. They knew that 10 years ago the mistake that
they made was their fault, but at the end of the day, the Jews of Banu Nadir knew, the
Muslims always kept their promises and the Muslims always gave them the freedom of religion. The Jewish Banu Nadir tribe was very good
at making army uniforms and swords. To help the Muslims, they joined the war and
made a lot of war items so that the Muslims would be safe. The Muslims had about 40 thousand soldiers
and the Romans had more than 200,000 soldiers. The battlefield was around 6 miles long. So far, this was the biggest battle for the
Muslims and one of the most critical battles in army history. Abu Ubaidah was the Muslim commander in chief,
but for this war, he asked Khalid bin Walid to be the main commander in chief. Many famous people’s children, joined this
battle like Abu Jahal’s son, Ikrimah, Khalid bin Walid(r) ’s son, Abu Bakr’s (r) son,
Umar’s (r) son, Uthman (r)’s son, and Ali (r) nephews. As we know, the Battle of Badr was the first
battle for the Muslims with only 313 soldiers. And for this war, around 100 of those great
Muslim soldiers also joined the Battle of Yarmouk. From Yemen, 5,000 archers, or arrow shooters
came to join the war. Many other powerful people also joined the
battle. 71-year-old Abu Sufyan and his wife Hind also
joined that battle to protect Islam. Many regular people and lots of women also
joined this war for Islam. Finally, the day came for the Battle of Yarmouk
during August of 636, four years after Prophet Muhammad (s)'s death. On the first day, both armies divided their
soldiers into four big groups. Shurahbil, Amr ibn al-As, Uncle Yazid, and
Abu Ubaidah (r) was in charge of each of the big army groups. The Romans had 5 horse groups and the Muslims
had 4 horse groups. As a commander in chief Khalid (r) was also
in charge of the horse groups. On the second day, the very big and strong
Roman army strongly attacked and weakened the Muslims' right and left sides of the army. At one point, the Muslims started to run away. But some Muslim women like Hind, Abu Sufyan's
wife, and other sahabi's wives showed their braveness and tried to stop the Muslim men
from running away. They insulted the men for being cowards and
scared. Then the Muslim women took their husband’s
sword and they started to fight against the big Roman army. When their husbands saw that, they got their
courage again and went back to stop the big Roman army. On the third day, the Romans did not attack
the left side. They attack the Muslims' weak side, which
was on the right. Khaled (r) divided his horse group in two
and tried to help the weak side and stopped the Romans for that day. On the fourth day, the Romans again attacked
very strongly and started to throw arrows at the Muslims. It was a very sad day for Muslims. Almost 700 Muslims lost an eye. Abu Sufyan also lost his eye during this fight. It was known as the 'day of lost eyes'. But the Muslims had their strong faith in
Allah (SWT) and tried their best to stop the Roman army. The Romans were very surprised that, their
big and strong army could not destroy the Muslim army. In these 4 days, the Romans lost many of their
soldiers. So, on the fifth day, the Romans did not want
to fight and wanted to stop the fight. Khaled (r) realized that the Romans became
tired and they might escape from the battlefield and come back with more soldiers. So, at night, he sent 500 horses behind the
Roman army to block their only escape route. Every day the Romans attacked first. Khaled (r) realized that now it was Muslim's
turn. On the final sixth day, he gathered all the
horses together and made one single strong horse group. He ordered the Muslims to attack first. As soon as the Muslims attacked, he quickly
went to the right side with a strong horse group and destroyed the Romans on that side. The Muslims quickly attacked the next group. The Romans were surprised by Khalid (r)'s
speed and sudden attack. All the Roman horse groups got together to
stop Khalid (r) but they were late and were destroyed by Khalid (r)'s horse group. At one point, they tried to escape the battlefield
but realized that their path was blocked by the Muslims. They were trapped by the two rivers and the
Muslim army destroyed the most powerful army at that time. Winning this battle made the Muslims a superpower
in that land and made Khaled bin Walid (r) a great fighter and commander in chief in
the history of all time. The Muslim women also were great heroes in
this battle. Did you know one of the top Muslim generals
was a woman called Khawlah (r)! She learned to fight from her brother, Dhiraar. In the battle of Yarmouk, her brother was
arrested by Roman soldiers. So the brave Khawlah (r) dressed as a man
and went all the way to the back of the Roman army camp and save her brother. One time when her brother was fighting against
the Romans, he got hurt and they took him back to the Roman’s side. Khawlah (r) was protective of her older brother
so she dressed like a man and went all the way to the back of the Roman army to save
her older brother. In another situation against the Romans, when
many Muslim men were scared to fight against the strong Roman army, Khawlah (r) went straight
towards them to fight. Many people thought she was Khalid bin Walid
and followed her. Khalid bin Walid thought she was a man fighting
and was wondering who that good fighter was. Later, Khalid (r) asked her who she was. Khawlah (r) did not reply for a long time
until finally she removed the cloth from her face and told him that her name was Khawlah. Khalid bin Walid was shocked as one by one
all of her took off their face coverings and he saw that they were all women fighting like
some of the soldiers on the battlefield. So, in the Battle of Yarmouk, Khawlah easily
became one of the top generals. Even when the men were scared, Khawlah herself
led an entire group of female warriors to protect Islam. Muslim women had a big part in this war. And they showed us it does not matter if someone
is a man or a woman, we can make a difference and we are able to do anything if we truly
want it. They show us that we should always give women
proper respect and opportunity because they just might be the reason for our strength
and our success."
"Refusing to pay Zakat All around Arabia, except for Medina, Makkah, and Ta’if, Shaytan was trying to weaken
the new Muslims’ Iman or belief in many different ways. The 5 pillars of Islam are extremely important
for all Muslims. But, the evil made the new Muslims not want
to pay their zakat. This was very dangerous because if Muslims
do not follow the pillars of Islam, that would weaken our Iman. And if Muslims have different definitions
of Iman, that would break the unity of the Muslim Ummah. In that situation, some of the good Muslims
were scared to do anything and thought it wasn’t a big deal because they were still
following the other pillars of Islam. But Abu Bakr (r) was very strict about following
Allah (SWT)’s law and order because he did not want anyone to change the real Islam. This made some of the new Muslim tribes really
mad, so they decided they would attack Medina. All of this was happening when the Muslim
army was still in the Arab-Roman border, trying to stop the big Roman army from destroying
the Muslims. Abu Bakr knew that there were only a few Muslims
left to protect Medina, the center of Islam at the time. But in that difficult situation, Abu Bakr
(r) had strong faith in Allah (SWT) and did not give up. To protect the city, the very smart Abu Bakr
(r) told some of the people to guard the prophet’s mosque. He also gave Zubair, Talha, Abdullah bin Masud
and Ali (r) the most important job. To guard the city of Medina and to keep an
eye on the enemies. When the enemy was coming, right away Abu
Bakr (r) himself left Medina with some Muslims to stop them. But the bad people used drums and other loud
sounds that scared the Muslims’ camels. Then the second time, with the help of Allah
(SWT), the Muslims were able to stop the bad people. With Allah’s miracle, Caliph Abu Bakr (r)
saved Medina, even though the Muslim army wasn’t there. Around the same time, the Muslims got another
good news. Usama (r)’s army returned from Syria after
winning the battle that stopped the big Roman army from attacking the main center of Islam. Everyone was so surprised when they heard
the news. In that battle, they won a lot of valuable
war items which made the Muslim army extremely strong. After this big success, the smaller tribes
who were planning to attack Medina because of the zakat situation got scared. They realized that even if the prophet was
no longer alive, the Muslims were still very strong and powerful with Allah (SWT)’s blessing. When the problem of Rome was solved, Caliph
Abu Bakr (r) wanted to establish peace agreements with their neighbors all around Arabia again. At that time, peace agreements were very important
to do business. People would trade with many different tribes
from north to south and east to west. During those times, they used very specific
paths, called trade routes. If a tribe did not like another tribe, they
could steal, and they would not be able to do their business safely. So, the peace agreements were a promise to
help each other as friends and to protect them from any trouble. During the Prophet's lifetime, many tribes
made peace agreements with the Muslims, but after Prophet Muhammad (s)’s death, they
thought all the peace agreements were over, and in their minds, they did not have any
peace agreement with the new caliph of Islam. They also thought the Muslims were not powerful
anymore to help their small tribes. That’s why many tribes broke off their peace
agreements after the prophet passed away. To solve this situation, Caliph Abu Bakr (r)
gathered strong Muslims from Mecca, Medina, and Ta’if and made a total of eleven army
groups. He sent each of the different groups to different
tribes all over Arabia to establish peace agreements again and to stop the fake Muslims
who were confusing and breaking the unity of the Muslim ummah. For this mission, Caliph Abu Bakr chose Khalid
bin Walid as his commander in chief. Some of the other top generals were Hudhaifah,
Shurahbil, Arfajah, Tarqah, Amr bin Al-As, Khalid bin Saeed and Ikrimah (r), who was
the bad Abu Jahal’s son. All of these Muslim generals left Medina and
went to different directions to bring back peace in Arabia. It was around 3 months after Muhammad (s)’s
death, in the month of Jumada Al- Thani of the 11 Hijri. Caliph Abu Bakr (r) sent the same message
to all the tribes. Each of the generals explained the Caliph’s
message to the tribes; that the prophet Muhammad (s) passed away because he was a human just
like us, and he was the last prophet and messenger of Allah (SWT). He only came to this earth to show us the
path of Allah (SWT). He came to bring justice and peace to this
world. He came to give us the last Holy Book, the
Quran, and show us how to follow Allah (SWT)'s law and order. And when his mission in this life was over,
that is when he had to go away, but the Quran, the laws of Islam, did not change, and it
will forever stay the same."
"Damascus Under Muslim Rule Caliph Abu Bakr was very brave and strong. His 4 Muslim generals peacefully spread the
message of Islam to the border towns of Rome to show that the Muslims didn’t want to
hurt anybody. The Muslims just wanted to show the beauty
of Islam and became friends. So, when the border towns saw this beauty
of Islam, many converted to Islam, and the others still supported and respected the Muslim. They knew if the Muslims ruled the land, they
would bringing peace and justice everywhere. They didn’t want the very bad, mean, and
cruel Roman King Heraclius to be their leader, because he only liked Christianity. He did not like other religions. They knew if someone did not follow Christianity,
he would punish them. Remember the Roman King Heraclius forced the
people to be Christians and did not believe in the freedom of religion. When King Heraclius heard that the people
in the border towns were becoming Muslims, he got really mad. So he ordered his people to keep hurting the
border town's new Muslims and forced them to follow Christianity. During this situation, Caliph Abu Bakr (r)
told the commander in chief Khalid bin Walid (r) to leave Persia and join the other 4 generals
who were already in the Roman empire. In order to scare the Muslims, King Heraclius’s
brother Theodore joined the war as commander in chief, but that didn’t scare the Muslims,
and the Muslims won the war. This was so embarrassing for King Heraclius
that his own brother couldn’t even stop the small Muslim army. He became very sad and ran away from this
embarrassing situation to Constantinople, which was the Roman capital. In present-day that’s in Istanbul, Turkey
Finally, this was a little bit of good news for the Muslims, but they knew the Romans
would come back with a bigger army to destroy the Muslims. As you see, all this time the bad people attacked
the Muslims first, then Muslims were forced to join the war. But now if the Muslims don’t attack first,
the Romans could build a stronger army to destroy all the Muslims. So, the Muslim army got ready and started
to travel north to one of the most important trading centers of the Arab world, the city
of Damascus, which was the capital of Syria. The Roman soldiers were scared to fight against
the small Muslim army face to face. Because they saw that the Muslim commander
in chief Khalid bin Walid was winning every single battle. Whenever they heard his name, the Roman soldiers
would get scared. With the help of Allah, Khalid bin Walid never
lost a single battle in his life. When the Muslims finally came to Damascus,
the Roman soldiers got scared and hid behind their town walls. In that situation, the commander in chief
Khalid bin Walid decided to divide the Muslim generals and their armies to guard the different
gates of Damascus. Here the other generals were Abu Ubaidah who
was the second in command, Shurahbil, Abu Sufyan’s son: Yazid, and Amr bin al-As (r). King Heraclius ordered the Roman soldiers
of Damascus to destroy the Muslims. So, the Roman soldiers shot arrows and threw
huge rocks over their walls at the Muslims. This made it a very hard and long fight for
the Muslims. The Romans were waiting for the cold winter. They thought the Muslims would leave as soon
as winter came because the Muslims were not used to the extreme cold weather. The thing is, not everyone inside Damascus
wanted to hurt the Muslims. The common people of Damascus actually liked
the Muslims. Even the governor of Damascus didn’t like
King Heraclius at all. Because he took very high taxes from the people
and made them poor. He used that tax money to buy very expensive
things for himself. The soldiers who worked directly for the king
kept on attacking the Muslims because of the king’s orders. So, the general people didn’t know what
to do. Then one night, the Romans were having a big
party. They ate lots of food and drank wine. Because of the wine, the Romans soldiers couldn’t
do their job properly. At that moment, Khalid bin Walid decided to
take his men through the Eastern gate. Even though it was the hardest gate to enter,
he decided to go because there were only a few Roman guards on that side. In secret, he and some of his men climbed
over the walls and then opened up the gates for the rest of his men to come. When Khalid bin Walid’s men already came
through the Eastern part of the town, the Roman army leader realized that there was
no way they could win. So quickly, he decided to meet with the second
in command, Abu Ubaidah and surrendered the city, and made a peace agreement with the
Muslims. Since they made a peace agreement with Abu
Ubaidah, the Muslims honored their promises. Here, they promised the people of Damascus
could live in peace and have the freedom of religion. At dawn, as the sun rose, it was a new beginning
for the Muslims as they entered the city of Damascus: the land that was promised by Allah
(SWT) during the time of the prophet. Now finally, after all these years, in the
year 634, Damascus became a part of the Muslim empire with Abu Sufyan’s son, General Yazid
as the first governor of Damascus."
"Episode 11: Fall of Persia Persia was a very strong empire. But the Persian rulers were very greedy. They started to destroy their own brothers
for power, and they created many problems in their country. And most especially, they were not giving
any freedom to their people. So, a lot of the Persian people started to
like the Islamic laws. That's why the Persian king did not like the
Muslims at all. Before the Battle of Yarmouk, the very long-time
enemies, the Romans and the Persians united together to become friends. So the Roman king Heraclius granddaughter
and 10-year-old Persian King, Yazdegerd III, got married. To destroy the Muslims, the Persians built
a very large army with 100,000 soldiers. When Caliph Umar (r) saw that both the Roman
and Persian got together, he realized that Muslims needed two strong armies. One for the Battle of Yarmouk and another
to stop the Persian empire. Umar (r) planned to use all of his army power
to stop the very strong Roman army. And for Persia, he focused on all the small
tribes in Arabia and united them to protect Islam. He chose Sa'ad (r) as their leader, who was
a Quraysh, Mecca's Muslim, and the 7th person to become a Muslim. With the help of Allah (swt), Sa'ad (r) could
unite different tribes of Arabia to stop the Persian soldiers. Sa'ad (r) took his small army and started
to move to the Persian border, to protect the border town new Muslims. Sa'ad (r) did not have a lot of experience
as commander of chief. So, from Madina, Umar (r) was giving every
direction to Sa'ad (r) and his army. Umar (r) did not want to start any battle
with the Persians at that time. Because at the same time the Muslims needed
more soldiers in Yarmouk to stop the big Roman army. So, he advised Sa'ad (r) to delay their time
by having lots of meetings with Persia. With Allah (swt)'s blessing, by this time,
the Muslim already won the Yarmouk battle. Then Umar (r) slowly started to move some
of the Muslim soldiers from Yarmouk to the Persian town in Qadissiyyah, present-day close
to Kufa in Iraq. As Umar (r) great plan, the Muslims got 3
months after the battle of Yarmouk to build a strong army with 30 thousand soldiers and
8 thousand horses to stop Persia, but Persia was way more stronger than the Muslims. They had 50 thousand soldiers, 20 thousand
horses, and 40 very big elephants. Persian soldiers had very strong and thick
war clothes and weapons. 4 years after the Prophet Muhammad (s) death,
in November of 636, both sides were ready for the Battle of Qadissiyyah. They both divided their strength into 4 groups. Persia started the battle by trying to attack
the Muslims with big elephants and large horse groups and destroyed a lot of Muslim soldiers. On the 2nd day, the Persian elephants were
in the back. So, Muslims attacked first. By this time Al Qaqa (r) and his army came
from Yarmouk, Syria to join this battle. He had a very smart idea. He divided his soldiers into many small groups
and told them to join the battle group by group. Seeing this the Persians got scared. They thought lots of Muslim soldiers were
coming to join the battle. The smart Muslim general Al Qaqa (r) covered
his camels to look like a big scary animal. Seeing that the Persian horses got scared
to see that scary fake animal. So, the Persians did bad that day. On the 3rd day, the Persians attacked with
their very heavy arrows and destroyed many Muslim soldiers. Then attacked harder with their elephants
and horses. It made the Muslims very weak. Then Muslims tried to destroy the elephants. At one point they were able to destroy some
of their elephants. Seeing that the other elephants got scared
and started to run away from the battlefield. On the way, they destroyed lots of their own
Persian soldiers. It was a very bad day for both sides. Lots of soldiers died on that day. On the 4th day, Allah (swt) sent a huge sandstorm. In the morning, Al Qaqa (r) took a strong
horse group and suddenly attacked the center and destroyed the Persian main commander in
chief Rostam. By noon the Persian army was destroyed by
the brave Muslims and started to run away from the battlefield. The Muslims lost around 10 thousand soldiers
and the Persian lost around 25 thousand soldiers in that battle. It was a great victory for the Muslims. Basically, after that battle, Persia lost
Iraq and the Muslims could finally give the freedom of religion to the Iraqi people."
"EP 14  - The First Welfare System
Caliph Umar (r) ruled the Rashidun Caliphate for 10 ½ years, and during his time, the
Muslim empire spread peacefully in many of the Roman and Persian areas. The Muslim empire
got so big that it included all of the middle east areas including Egypt, Libya, Azerbaijan,
Armenia, Georgia, Iraq, and Iran. Caliph Umar (r) created a strong centralized government,
police department, court system, and prison or jail system. Caliph Umar (r) was very strict
and never put any of his family members or relatives in a powerful position. He also
changed his governors about every 2 years, so they could not have too much power in one
area and divide or even divide the Muslim Ummah. As cities got bigger, they had to solve
the water problem, so he built lots of wells and dug canals. He also created the Arabic
Hijri calendar. Caliph Umar (r) created a strong paid army system and the army headquarters.
Even during his time, the official land measuring system started. He also started the system
where they would count how many people were living in the Islamic empire to help them
properly. When the Muslim empire was getting bigger and bigger, he started bringing in
new ideas to manage the system to help the people in the best way possible. One of his
great ideas was to create the first Islamic Treasure center known as the Bait-ul-Mal,
the house of money. During the prophet and Abu Bakr (r)'s time, all the money or assets
of the government would be divided between the people as soon as possible. But Caliph
Umar (r) decided to save the money or assets to build public places, like, roads, bridges,
canals, mosques, orphanages, retirement plans, disability benefits, child benefits, and even
army protection so that all Muslims and non-Muslims would be safe in the Islamic empire from the
enemies. Medina had the main or central Bayt-ul-Mal or treasury building. Each town also had a
branch of the Bayt-ul-Mal system. This system also helped create many jobs. For example,
some people were keeping records of how the money was spent, and others were in charge
of guarding or protecting the building. Caliph Umar (r) also started the world’s first
welfare system, so everyone had the basic needs of life. The Muslim government made
sure that everyone had Food, Clothing, Housing, Healthcare, and Education for both boys and
girls. The Muslim government also gave money to the needy children, widows, orphans, poor,
disabled, and those who are too old. The Muslim world was extremely advanced in this welfare
system. This system was so advanced that the Western world first started this kind of advanced
system only during the 1800s. Caliph Umar (r) also started the 'open trade' system in
the Muslim world so people had freedom when doing their business.
Caliph Umar (r) discovered many modern ideas to help the people. He also worked very hard
to please Allah (SWT). And because of that, Allah (SWT) blessed him more than we could
have ever imagined. Umar (r) was a very honest Caliph. During his time, the Muslim empire
became very rich. But his lifestyle was extremely simple. He would always eat simple, dry, and
hard foods. Sometimes his guests did not like to eat his food. They couldn’t believe how
the powerful caliph or the leader of the Muslim empire could eat such simple foods. One time
a group of Persians came to see Caliph Umar (r). At that time, he was sleeping on the
ground and was using rocks as his pillow. He also had no weapons or guards with him.
They were surprised to see that the leader of such a big empire was living such a simple
lifestyle. His clothes were very old and simple with many patches. One time the people were
waiting for Caliph Umar (r) to lead their prayer. It was getting really late, but still,
he wasn’t coming. Finally, he came, and apologized to his people, and said that he
was waiting for his clothes to dry because he had only one pair of clothes. The people
felt bad and advised him to take some money from the Bayt-ul Mal or the welfare programs.
Caliph Umar (r) told them that he can't take the people’s money without all of their
permission. Sometimes he would be starving because he didn’t have anything to eat.
Onetime his closest advisors and Ali (r) told him that of course, he had permission to have
money from the Bayt-ul-Mal for his living, especially because he’s the caliph. So,
with everyone's permission, Umar (r) took a very little monthly salary just to survive.
Umar's (r) simple and honest lifestyle helped many non-Muslims to accept Islam.
He knew it was his responsibility to take care of that big empire and showed the beauty
of Islam to everyone by following Allah's (SWT) laws and orders. He even created a secret
intelligence program or undercover agents to go around and find the poor and needy,
so that he could help them. But, some bad Persian people did not like Islam at all and
planned to do the most evil thing, which was to kill Caliph Umar (r). The Persians knew
that Caliph Umar (r) was a simple man, and he didn’t carry any weapons or have any
guards to protect him. One time a bad non-Muslim Persian named Piruz came to Caliph Umar (r).
He started to complain about his taxes as an excuse to get close to him. Caliph Umar
(r) treated him with respect and kindness and let him stay as a guest. At night that
evil Persian guy dipped his sharp knife in poison. The next morning, on October 31st
of 644, he was waiting in a corner. As soon as Caliph Umar (r) started leading the morning
prayer the evil guy immediately used his poised knife and hurt the caliph 6 times behind his
back! Caliph Umar (r) fell to the ground senseless. The people tried to save their caliph and
tried to stop the evil guy. He also hurt 12 other people with his knife, and around half
of them later died. When he couldn’t get away, he decided to destroy himself. When
Umar (r) got his sense back, in his house, he asked who was that bad guy. Hearing the
answer, he became very happy that the bad guy was not a Muslim
The doctors tried but could not stop his bleeding. Then Caliph Umar (r) realized that his time
was soon going to be over. His advisors requested him to pick their next caliph. So he created
a group with Uthman, Ali, Zubair, Talha, AbdurRahman, and Sa’d (r) and advice them to choose their
next caliph from that great Sahaba group. He had only one last wish that his grave would
be next to his closest friends prophet Muhammad (s) and the great Abu Bakr (r). Umar (r) immediately
sent his older son Abdullah (r) to get permission from Aisha (r), because she had plans to have
her own grave next to her husband Muhammad (s) and her father Abu Bakr (r). But she knew
that Umar (r) was a great Muslim and was very close with the prophet and Abu Bakr. So, she
happily fulfilled Umar (r)'s last wish and gave permission by giving up her spot. Then
three days later, on November 3, in the year 644, Umar (r)took his last breath as the second
caliph of Islam, and his grave is next to Abu Bakr (r). May Allah (SWT) give him the
highest place in Jannah for his great work for the Muslim Ummah. Ameen."
"False Prophets of Arabia  Before, we talked about how some of the Muslims  didn’t want to follow the 5 pillars of Islam like&nbsp;
giving zakat. Later after the 11 groups went to&nbsp;&nbsp; each of the tribes, they understood their mistake.&nbsp;
But at the same time, there were also actual&nbsp;&nbsp; evil people who wanted to destroy Islam. In order&nbsp;
to understand why the evil people were doing this&nbsp;&nbsp; evil act, we need to focus on what happened after&nbsp;
Prophet Muhammad (s)'s death to understand the&nbsp;&nbsp; whole picture of the Arab land. When Muhammad (s)&nbsp;
became a Prophet at the age of 40, almost all the&nbsp;&nbsp; people and tribes did not accept or supported&nbsp;
him at first. After 23 years of hard work and&nbsp;&nbsp; patience, Allah (SWT) made him successful in the&nbsp;
three major cities of Arabia. Makkah, Medina, and&nbsp;&nbsp; Taif. Seeing that, the bad people thought that if&nbsp;
someone claimed themselves as a prophet, it would&nbsp;&nbsp; be easier for them to control the people and the&nbsp;
land. They thought that would be the easiest way&nbsp;&nbsp; to get powerful and become a leader or a king.&nbsp;
So right after the Prophet Muhammad (s) success,&nbsp;&nbsp; many tribe leaders started to claim&nbsp;
themselves as a new prophet. When doing this,&nbsp;&nbsp; they started to lie and started to twist the&nbsp;
real Islam, which made the new Muslims confused,&nbsp;&nbsp; so the 11 groups that Caliph Abu&nbsp;
Bakr (r) created, had two big jobs:&nbsp; #1. Establish peace agreements&nbsp;
again between all of Arabia&nbsp; #2. Spread the true Islam and&nbsp;
stop the false prophets who&nbsp;&nbsp; were confusing &amp; breaking the Muslim’s unity.
Soon the new commander in chief Khalid bin Walid&nbsp;&nbsp; and all of the other generals of&nbsp;
11 groups started their journey.
 &nbsp; One of the false prophets was an evil liar named&nbsp;
Tulaihah. He knew that the Muslims would not like&nbsp;&nbsp; his big lie. To protect himself, he united some of&nbsp;
the bad tribes to fight against the Muslims. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; in that situation, Caliph Abu Bakr (r) sent Khalid&nbsp;
bin Walid to stop the bad Tulaihah. But Tulaihah&nbsp;&nbsp; was scared to fight with the strong Muslim army. 
 
So, the bad Tulaihah told his army to fight&nbsp;&nbsp; against the Muslims, but he would not join the&nbsp;
fight. Instead, he would pretend and wait to&nbsp;&nbsp; get some revelations from his god. After starting&nbsp;
the fight, one of his army generals later realized&nbsp;&nbsp; that Tulaihah was a liar and a false prophet.&nbsp;
He told his soldiers not to fight for that false&nbsp;&nbsp; prophet and accept Islam. Within a short time,&nbsp;
many of them became Muslim, and the bad Tulaihah&nbsp;&nbsp; ran away to Syria with his wife. A few years&nbsp;
later, he became Muslim when Umar (r) was the&nbsp;&nbsp; caliph. All the other bad soldiers ran away from&nbsp;
the battlefield and got together in another place.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over there, they organized more bad people for&nbsp;
their evil army. But this time, they chose an&nbsp;&nbsp; evil lady named Salma as their commander&nbsp;
in chief. After hearing that news, Khalid&nbsp;&nbsp; (r) stopped that evil army and destroyed them.
 
In central Arabia, one of the strongest enemies&nbsp;&nbsp; was the evil Musailamah. He had a strong army of&nbsp;
more than 40 thousand soldiers! He was very smart&nbsp;&nbsp; and was a good speaker. So, his people respected&nbsp;
him very much. He had his beautiful palace in&nbsp;&nbsp; Yamamah, which is in present-day Riyadh, around&nbsp;
500 miles from Makkah and Medina. Because he was&nbsp;&nbsp; greedy for power, he started to lie and called&nbsp;
himself a prophet. He started twisting the real&nbsp;&nbsp; Islam and that confused a lot of the new Muslims&nbsp;
since Islam was not strong in their hearts yet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the same time, a bad woman named&nbsp;
Sajah also claimed to be a prophet as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were both starting to become powerful. But&nbsp;
when they heard that the caliph Abu Bakr (r) was&nbsp;&nbsp; sending different groups to stop all of the fake&nbsp;
prophets, they were scared. They knew the Muslims&nbsp;&nbsp; were strong, and Allah (SWT) was on the true&nbsp;
Muslim’s side. So, for their protection, the evil&nbsp;&nbsp; Musailamah and Sajah married each other to become&nbsp;
even stronger. And together they both made a plan&nbsp;&nbsp; to attack Medina, which was the main center&nbsp;
of Islam at that time. When Sajah came back&nbsp;&nbsp; to her followers after her wedding, she told them&nbsp;
that as a marriage gift they did not have to pray&nbsp;&nbsp; their morning and night-time prayers anymore. This&nbsp;
was an example of how they were changing the true&nbsp;&nbsp; Islam. But in the meantime, after the Muslims&nbsp;
won the war against the big Roman army, both&nbsp;&nbsp; Musailamah and Sajah were scared to attack Medina.&nbsp;
When Khalid bin Walid and his army came to attack&nbsp;&nbsp; the evil Sajah’s army, they all got very scared&nbsp;
and ran away and left their false prophet leader&nbsp;&nbsp; all by herself. Finally, she also decided to&nbsp;
run away and was no longer a threat to Islam. Now for Musailamah, Caliph Abu Bakr (r)&nbsp;
sent the Muslim army general Ikrimah (r)&nbsp;&nbsp; who was Abu Jahal's son. But the evil&nbsp;
Musailamah had a very strong army. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Muslim army could not win the battle. Then&nbsp;
Caliph Abu Bakr (r) send Khalid bin Walid (r)&nbsp;&nbsp; with a strong army of 13 thousand soldiers.&nbsp;
It was a very big fight for the Muslim&nbsp;&nbsp; army because the bad liar had 40 thousand&nbsp;
soldiers. At first, for the Muslims, it was&nbsp;&nbsp; really hard. But they kept their faith in Allah&nbsp;
(SWT) and did not give up. With that strong faith,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Muslims started to destroy the enemy.&nbsp;
Then many of the enemies started to run away.&nbsp;&nbsp; Around 6 thousand enemies got scared and hid at&nbsp;
Musailamah's garden and closed the gates. But&nbsp;&nbsp; the Muslims were brave and broke into the garden,&nbsp;
and soon the garden became a battlefield as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Muslim army was almost close to winning&nbsp;
the battle, the false prophet Musailama tried to&nbsp;&nbsp; escape. At that moment the Muslim soldier&nbsp;
Wahshi took his spear and destroyed Musailama.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Wahshi became a Muslim, he was the slave&nbsp;
who destroyed the great Hamza (r) in the Battle&nbsp;&nbsp; of Uhud. After destroying Musailamah, seeing that,&nbsp;
many of his men got scared and ran away and many&nbsp;&nbsp; realized that he was not the prophet at all.&nbsp;
This battle was very important for the Muslims&nbsp;&nbsp; in order to bring peace in central Arabia. Because&nbsp;
Musailamah was one of the main leaders of that&nbsp;&nbsp; area. His people were always breaking the law,&nbsp;
and they were twisting the message of Allah.&nbsp;&nbsp; His people also used to steal when others were&nbsp;
in the middle of trading with one another. For&nbsp;&nbsp; those bad people, the Muslims and general people&nbsp;
could not travel and do their business trade.&nbsp;&nbsp; And that’s why it was so important to stop&nbsp;
them. This is known as the Battle of Yamamah In this battle, even though the Muslims won, the&nbsp;
Muslim army lost around 1 thousand great Sahabas.&nbsp;&nbsp; And unfortunately, 400 to 700 of&nbsp;
these great heroes were the Huffuz,&nbsp;&nbsp; who memorized the entire Quran&nbsp;
with all of their hearts. After losing many Huffuz in the Battle of Yamama,&nbsp;&nbsp; Caliph Abu Bakr and Umar (r) realize&nbsp;
the importance of an official Quran&nbsp;&nbsp; in a form of a book. InshaAllah in the&nbsp;
next episode, we will know how they did it."
"First Caliph: Abu Bakr (r) After prophet Muhammad (s)’s funeral, the
next day, the first caliph or the leader of the Muslim ummah, Abu Bakr as-Siddiq (r) gave
his speech to the Muslims and promised to follow Allah (SWT)’s law and order as a
good Muslim leader. He told them that if he did anything wrong,
they should put him on the right path. On that day 33,000 Muslims accepted Abu Bakr
(r) as the first caliph of Islam and they promised to help him as long as he followed
the path of Allah. And this was the beginning of the Rashidun
caliphate or the rightly-guided caliphate. As we said before, the Muslims chose Abu Bakr
(r) as their leader very fast. So, some very important sahabas like Zubair,
Talha, and Ali (r) were not in that very important meeting. They loved Abu Bakr (r) as their next leader
but they wanted to be in that meeting and didn’t understand why they weren’t invited. At the beginning of Islam, both Zubair and
Talha (r) became Muslims after hearing about Islam from Abu Bakr (r). Ali (r) knew that Muhammad (s) was not a king,
he was a prophet which is why the people elected Abu Bakr. And he knew that Abu Bakr (r) was a very good
person to be the leader for the Muslims. So, one day Ali (r) asked him why such an
important decision was taken without some of the very close Sahabas of the Prophet. Ali (r) explained that if he was there at
that moment, he would be the first one to take the oath. Then Abu Bakr (r) told him that he respected
Ali (r) more than his own relatives, and then explained the whole situation to Ali (r). He told him that he didn’t go to be the
leader for the Muslims, he went to stop a big fight that would have divided the Muslim
ummah, and then all of the sudden, it was the people who decided to choose him. Hearing that Ali (r) understood the situation. The next day in front of a lot of people in
the Prophet’s Mosque, Ali (r) accepted Caliph Abu Bakr (r) as his leader and promised to
help and stay loyal to him. And throughout Abu Bakr (r)’s rule, Ali
(r) was a very close and helpful advisor when ruling over the Muslim Ummah. It was important especially during that moment
to have a strong leader with good advisors to help the Muslim Ummah. This is because after our prophet Muhammad
(s) passed away, many of the neighboring tribes thought the Muslims became powerless. They thought it would be impossible for Islam
to exist without a prophet. So, Shaytan tried to break the Muslims’
unity in many different ways. Some of the evil people decided not to follow
Islam anymore, others broke their peace agreements, and some thought it would be a perfect time
to attack and destroy the Muslims and become a powerful leader themselves. Almost everywhere in Arabia, they were planning
to destroy Islam. But in that difficult moment, only the people
of Medina, Makkah, and Ta’if were good. They were true Muslims and tried to protect
Islam. During the last month of prophet Muhammad
(s)’s life, a small area near the Arab-Roman border, some of the Romans were planning to
attack Medina and destroy Islam. So, the prophet ordered Usamah (r) and his
army to stop them. But at that moment the prophet got really
sick, so they did not go at that time and decided to wait. When the prophet had passed away, the Romans
were planning to attack Medina. The new Caliph of Islam, Abu Bakr (r) decided
that the best thing to do in that situation was to fulfill the prophet’s last order. So, he decided to send the Muslim army to
protect themselves from the big Roman army. Hearing that order, many Muslims got scared
to fight with the strong Roman army during that time. They were scared if the Muslim army left to
go fight with the Romans in Syria, the evil neighbors might attack Medina. Because at that time Medina was the main center
of Islam. The brave Caliph Abu Bakr (r) was very strict
about his decision. He told the people, that this was a direct
order from the prophet Muhammad (s) before he passed away. After hearing that the Muslims then understood
the importance of this order. The Muslim army was getting ready just outside
of Medina to go on their mission. Unfortunately, many of the soldiers did not
like their army commander, Usamah (r) for two reasons. The first reason was, Usamah (r)’s father
Zayd (r) was a slave and the second reason was because he was only 17 years old. Some Muslims thought that he did not have
enough experience, and was too young to lead an entire army of 3,000 sahabahs. When Caliph Abu Bakr (r) got the message,
he became very upset at the Muslim army. Because that choice wasn’t even his, it
was the prophet’s choice. Then he gave the 17-year-old general, Usamah
(r), the highest level of respect in front of the entire army. The army realized their mistake. Without wasting any time, Caliph Abu Bakr
(r) started to walk beside Usamah (r) horse and explained the ‘10 Rules of War,’ and
that he has to strictly follow those rules as a Muslim at all times. Do not steal
Do not lie Do not break other people’s trust
Do not hurt any children, women, or old people Do not cut down fruit trees
Do not destroy camels, cows, or goat for no reason unless it’s for eating
Tell the people about Islam Give respect to anyone you meet
Start eating by saying Bismillah Do not fight with the Jews and Christians
if they are in their temples or churches. Umar (r) was in that Muslim army. To protect Medina, Caliph Abu Bakr (r) requested
the young Usamah (r) if Umar (r) could stay back in Medina. This was surprising to many people because
even though Caliph Abu Bakr (r) was the elected leader for the Muslim people, he still asked
permission from the very young 17-year-old army general. Soon the Muslim army of 3,000 soldiers reached
Syria in a valley between Jardon and Balqa. The strong Roman army was ready to fight the
Muslims and thought it would be easy to destroy the Muslim small army. But the brave Muslim soldiers put all of their
faith in Allah (SWT) and fought against their biggest enemy at that time. These were the same Roman enemies who destroyed
many of the Muslims in the Battle of Mutah including Usamah (r)’s father, Zayd (r),
who was also the prophet’s adopted son. Finally, with the help of Allah (SWT), Usamah
(r) and his army won the battle against the big Roman army and came back home after 40
days. This was the first battle of the Rashidun
Caliphate where the Muslims protected themselves from the strong Roman army. This event was extremely important because
it showed everyone that even if the prophet died, Islam was not weak, especially when
all the Muslims comes together peacefully by putting their faith in Allah (SWT)."
"The First Quran Book
We all know that our creator Allah (s) sent the Quran to our last prophet Muhammad (s),
and it took around 23 years to complete the entire Quran. To keep the words of Allah (SWT) safe, the
prophet gave certain people a very special job. Their job was to write down all the words
of Allah (SWT). At that time, they did not have paper. So, they used tree trunks, leather, palm leaves,
stones, and bones. At that time, most people did not know how
to read and write. But the Arab people had a talent for memorization. So, when Islam came, the Muslims focused on
memorizing the Quran with all of their hearts. After the Battle of Yamamah, around 1 thousand
Muslim soldiers were killed, and many of them were the Huffaz, who memorized the Quran with
all of their hearts. Seeing that, Umar (r) got really scared. Because using the memorization power is how
the Muslims kept the Quran safe. But if the bad people destroyed all the Huffaz,
then how could the Quran exist. Because Abu Bakr (r) was the caliph of the
Muslim world at that time, Umar (r) told him that they needed to put together the entire
Quran all together in one place to protect the Quran. At first, hearing this, Caliph Abu Bakr was
scared to do this. He asked Umar (r), how could he do something
that even the prophet didn’t do. We need to understand that the prophet did
not know when he was going to die. Because of that, he also did not know when
he would get the last revelation from Allah (SWT). So, there was no way the prophet could order
to collect and finalize the Quran. Finally, Caliph Abu Bakr realized that this
was very important and a big responsibility to protect the Quran forever. He then decided to make a team, and together
they would collect every piece of the Quran and put them together in one official book. For the leader of this team, Caliph Abu Bakr
(r) picked the very smart Zaid ibn Thabit (r). When the prophet was alive, he was one of
his personal writers with the special job of writing down the Quran. Many famous sahaba were also part of this
big project as well. For example, Ali, Uthman, Talha, Abdullah,
Ubbay ibn Kab, Hudhaifah, Saleem, and many others (pbut). For this big project, there were a lot of
rules that they had to follow, to make sure everything was perfect. This was how the first official Quran was
finished: Even though there were many people who memorized
the Quran, Caliph Abu Bakr (r) ordered to find every single piece of revelation that
was written in front of the prophet. Caliph Abu Bakr wanted the witnesses who were
there when the prophet was getting the revelation. For the last step, the Huffaz had the most
important part of this project. When the first official copy of the Quran
was made, Abu Bakr (r) called a general meeting where a total of 33 thousand sahabah came
together, and all agreed that every single letter of the Quran was in the right place. This final book was called a Mushaf, which
means ‘written verses’. This huge and important work was possible
with the leadership of Caliph Abu Bakr (r) and every single sahabi who were a part of
the biggest project in Islamic history. Keeping the words of Allah (s) safe even after
over 1400, and it will forever stay the same."
"First Battles Against the Persians Within a year after Caliph Abu Bakr (r) sent 11 army groups to establish peace agreements. The entire Arabia was finally in peace, but
now Arabia was surrounded by two very big enemies, Rome and Persia. The Christian Romans were on the northwest
side and the fire worshipping Persians were on the northeast side of Arabia. They did not like each other at all. Back when our prophet Muhammad (s) was spreading
the message of Islam all over Arabia, at the same time for many years, the Persians and
the Romans were too busy fighting with each other. So the border town people didn’t like their
Roman and Persian leaders at all. The bad Romans and Persians rulers did not
give their people freedom of religion. The Romans forced their people to become Christian,
and the Persians forced their people to worship fire. And if the people did not listen, they would
punish their people. Both of these empires also had their own problems
in the royal family. The bad King Heraclius married his own niece. Even in Christianity, this was a big sin. So many of his people did not like him anymore. Heraclius’s own brother, Theodore, also
did not like it and became very mad. The Persian king also was very bad. He was very greedy for more power and started
to destroy his own brothers. At one point, they started a civil war and
destroyed each other to be the leader. It was so bad that all the men in the Persian
royal family were destroyed. Finally, in the end, an eight-year-old boy
name Yazdegerd III became the Persian King. He was so young that Persian army leader Rostam
had to help him to run the country. And this made the Persians really weak. At that time, Yemen and Oman were under the
Persians' control, but when the Persians were fighting each other, Yemen and Oman decided
to use that opportunity and leave the Persian empire. And soon they decided to join the Muslim ruler
the Rashidun Caliphate. At first, the Persians and the Romans did
not care about the small Muslim power. But when Muslims were getting stronger day
by day, both empires got worried. When Caliph Abu Bakr (r)’s good leadership
qualities was able to unite the entire Arabia together, they got really scared. So, they planned to first attack the Muslim
border cities to break the Muslim unity and then slowly take over Medina. In this situation, Caliph Abu Bakr(r) tried
to spread Islam in the Roman and Persian border town areas. He then ordered the four top Muslim generals
to enter the Roman border town area and told them not to attack or destroy anything. Their only job at that moment was to peacefully
spread the message of Islam to the Syrian, Lebanese, Jordanian, and Palestinian Christians. The four top Muslim generals were Abu Ubaidah,
Amr, Shurahbil, and uncle Yazid. Just to clarify, this uncle Yazid was Abu
Sufyan’s son. He was a respected top Muslim general who
helped make Islam stronger. That’s why in this series, we will call
him uncle Yazid. Most people are familiar with his nephew,
the other Yazid, who will come much later, and he was Mu’awaiya’s son, who is known
to have a bad historical impression. At this point, since the majority of the Muslims
were Arabs, the non-Muslim Arabs in the border towns easily agreed to be on the Muslims’
side and helped them because they trusted their Arab brothers and sisters instead of
the Roman king. They also knew the Muslims were good and the
Muslims would give them the freedom to practice whatever religion they wanted to follow. At the same time, Caliph Abu Bakr (r) also
wanted to spread the message of Islam peacefully in Persia. So many Iraqi Arabs of Persia joined with
the Muslims to have the freedom of religion. Soon the message of Islam was peacefully spreading
all along the border towns of Rome and Persia. This was really important for the future of
Islam because slowly it was helping the Muslims become stronger. These non-Muslims Arabs in the border towns
wanted to have freedom and peace. They realized that even if they didn’t become
Muslims, they had much more freedom than before under the Muslim empire. And seeing this, many people also became Muslim
and followed the beautiful religion of Islam. One of the Persian border tribe leader’s
name was Muthanna. For many years, they used to fight against
the Persian empire for their freedom. When Muthanna heard about the message of Islam,
he and his people became Muslims. This made the Persians really mad, and they
were coming to destroy them all. Since Muthanna and his people were now under
the Muslim Caliphate, to solve their problem Caliph Abu Bakr (r) sent some Muslim soldiers
to help Muthanna stop the Persian army. Because Muthanna knew the Persian ways of
fighting, Caliph Abu Bakr (r) made Muthanna one of the Muslim generals. This was the first time the Muslims were involved
with one of the biggest empires at that time. Caliph Abu Bakr ordered commander in chief
Khalid bin Walid to join Muthanna. Together they stopped the Persians and protected
the Persian Muslim’s homes. But it was hard to fight against the Persians. In one of the battles, called the Battle of
the Chains, the Persian army chained themselves together to show that they were not scared
and was ready to die. One after another, the bad Persian army tried
to attack the Muslim border towns. Every time the Muslims first tried to make
a peace agreement so that both sides can have peace in the society. But they were too arrogant and thought they
were better than the Muslims. But the Muslims had a strong faith in Allah
(SWT) and tried to stop the evil power and bring peace and freedom to the people. One by one, the Muslims won the battle with
the help of Allah (SWT) and the people in the border towns, which made the Islamic empire
bigger. And soon, the Muslims got bigger all the way
up to the Euphrates River. One of the last places where they fought was
in Firaz, which bordered the Arabs, Persians, and the Romans. Here in the Battle of Firaz (لفراض) at
the Euphrates river, the Persians and the Romans joined together for the first time
to stop and hurt the Muslims. But the Muslims were not scared at all. At first, both the Persian and the Roman armies
were on the other side of the Euphrates River. Again, the Muslims offered to make a peace
agreement. But they decided to show their power and crossed
the river to fight against the Muslims. After crossing the river, they became tired,
and soon the Muslims won that war against the very strong enemy. That was Khalid bin Walid’s last fight against
the Persians. The bad Persians did not want peace with the
Muslims and the border towns, and soon because of their arrogance, the Muslims were finally
in control of the Persian Mesopotamia area in Iraq for the first time with the blessing
of Allah (SWT)."

" The Girl and the Ice Cream Truck An original tale by TheFableCottage.com A girl sits at her bedroom window, 
looking down at the street.  She is waiting for summer. She wants to eat ice cream and go swimming.  She wants picnics and strawberries.  She is tired of winter jackets and gloves.  She is tired of grey skies and snow. Her mother says that summer is far away. Her father says that more snow is coming. Still, she sits at the window waiting for some sign that summer has arrived. Just then, she sees an ice cream truck 
driving down the street. “An ice cream truck! That MUST mean it’s summer now!” she squeals. She runs to her closet and puts on 
her bathing suit and her summer hat.  She runs down the stairs and out the door and… CRUNCH! She looks down and sees her bare feet... ….in the icy grass. “But…but… I saw an ice cream truck!”  she says, confused. She looks up just in time to see the 
ice cream truck turn the corner ... ... and pull into the auto repair shop. Moral: Don’t draw a conclusion based on a single observation; one ice cream truck does not make a summer."
"The Oak Tree (A version of the tale by TheFableCottage.com) One hot day, two hikers are walking 
in the dry, brown hills. They have been walking all day, 
and they are tired and hungry.  They see a tree in the distance.  “I am sooooo hungry!” says one hiker. “Do you think that’s an apple tree? I want a big, crunchy, red apple!” “Nah, that’s not an apple tree,"" says the other. ""It's a pear tree! Pears are my favorite.  I want a sweet, juicy, yellow pear!""  But when they arrive at the tree,  there are no apples. Or pears either! In fact, there is no fruit at all.  “Aw, boo!"" says one hiker. ""It’s a useless oak tree!"" Just then, the sky turns grey 
and it starts to rain. The two hikers run under 
the oak tree to stay dry. It rains and rains, but the oak tree 
is like a big umbrella.  The hikers don't get wet. They wait under the oak tree 
for the rain to stop. Day turns into night.  “I’m cold,"" says one hiker. ""We should make a fire. Help me collect some wood!” Luckily, there are many old branches 
under the oak tree. The two hikers collect the branches 
and make a nice campfire out of them. They sit beside the fire to warm themselves. “I’m tired,” says one hiker.  ""We should sleep here tonight. Help me make a bed!""  The hikers make a bed out of 
soft, green oak leaves. They snuggle into the leaves 
and fall asleep.  The rain falls and the wind blows, but the hikers are comfortable, warm and dry — — under the ""useless"" oak tree.  Moral: Sometimes the best gifts 
aren’t what we originally hoped for."
"The Bird and the Whale (An original tale by TheFableCottage.com) Once there was a bird who fell in love with a whale. And a whale who fell in love with a bird. The bird loved the whale's beautiful smile. He loved the way she swam through the water so gracefully. The whale loved the bird's handsome white feathers. She loved to watch him soar through the sky. And they both loved to eat lots of tiny fish. All summer, the bird and the whale met in the bay. They talked and talked. They talked about the moon, and the stars,  and the ships on the ocean. The bird told jokes and made the whale laugh. The whale sang beautiful songs that made the bird cry (even though he didn't know why). ""One day, you could meet my family in the ocean,"" said the whale. ""And you could meet my friends on the land,"" said the bird. Everything was perfect. But the world does not stop turning just because a bird and whale fall in love.   Summer turned into autumn, and autumn turned into winter. The ocean turned cold, and all the other whales left for warmer waters. ""Come with me to warmer waters,"" said the whale. ""It’s a wonderful place. It's always warm, and there are so many fish to eat."" ""I love to eat fish,"" said the bird.  ""And I love you. I will follow you anywhere. But first, teach me to be a whale?"" ""Like this!"" said the whale, ""follow me!"" and she dived deep into the water. ""OK!"" said the bird, and he also dived deep into the water. Deeper and deeper he went. ""I'm swimming!"" he laughed.  ""I'm a whale!"" But soon he couldn't breathe.  He returned to the surface, gasping. He tried and tried and tried again, but he ran out of breath every time. ""I don't think a bird can become a whale,"" said the bird. ""Come with me instead! I live up on the cliffs. It's a wonderful place.  It's warm and cosy, and every morning you can watch the sun rise."" ""I love to watch the sun rise,"" said the whale. ""And I love you. I will follow you anywhere. But first, teach me to be a bird?"" ""Like this!"" said the bird. ""Follow me!"" and he flapped his wings and soared into the sky. ""OK!"" said the whale. She squeezed her eyes shut and flapped her fins, just like the bird. She flapped and flapped, up and down.  Water splashed everywhere! ""I'm flying!"" she laughed. ""I'm a bird!""   But when she opened her eyes, she wasn't soaring in the sky. She was still in the water. She tried and tried and tried again,  but she could not fly. ""I don't think a whale can become a bird,"" said the whale. ""But if you can't fly, and I can't swim, where can we live together?"" said the bird. ""We will stay here — in the waves!"" said the whale. But the bird shook his head sadly. ""You love to swim deep in the ocean,"" he said.  That is your favourite thing to do. You would never be happy here."" The whale sighed. ""And you love to fly and soar into the sky,"" she said. ""That is your favourite thing to do. You would never be happy here either."" And so, because the bird and whale loved each other so much, they said goodbye. But they never forgot each other. Every time the whale saw a bird flying high in the sky, she thought of her bird.  She hoped he was enjoying the skies — just like that. And every time the bird saw a whale diving deep in the ocean, he thought of his whale. He hoped she was enjoying the ocean — — just like that."
"The city mouse and the country mouse A version of the tale by TheFableCottage.com This is a city mouse. He lives in a big city with tall buildings 
and lots of shops and restaurants.  But today he is visiting his friend, 
a country mouse.  The country mouse lives in a cozy nest 
at the bottom of a tree. Her home is small, but it is warm 
and comfortable.  The country mouse cooks a dinner 
of food from her garden: corn, carrots, acorns and a cold glass of water from the stream Meanwhile, the city mouse talks and talks: The city is amazing!  I go to the theater and the museum... My house has TWENTY rooms. You absolutely MUST visit!  Have you ever tried Chinese food? That night, the country mouse dreams that she lives in the city. She dreams that she eats at fancy restaurants, says fancy things, and buys fancy hats from fancy stores. She dreams about eating Chinese food. ""How wonderful!"" she thinks. ""I want to live in the city too!"" The next morning the country mouse 
agrees to visit the city mouse. She packs her bag and follows the city mouse 
back to his big house in the city. The house is enormous! There are TWENTY rooms full of beautiful furniture.  The country mouse is amazed.  ""Which room is mine?"" she asks.  ""Um... we actually live down here…"" 
says the city mouse. He leads her down some stairs 
to the basement. In the darkness, the country mouse 
sees many families of mice. ""These are my housemates…"" 
explains the city mouse.  The city mouse leads the country mouse 
back upstairs for dinner. In the dining room there is a feast of 
delicious foods on the table: cheese, bread, cookies, cakes, and lemonade. There is also… Chinese food!  But just as they start to eat... CRASH! A cat with sharp teeth and sharp claws 
jumps up on the table. REEEEEOWWWW! The city cat chases the two mice 
off the table and across the floor. The mice hide in a hole in the wall.  They are trapped! They wait silently until the cat leaves.  Then, they quietly creep back to the dining room … but all the food is gone!  The city humans ate everything!  The country mouse hurries back to the 
basement and packs her bag.  ""Where are you going?"" asks the city mouse.  ""Home.” she says.  I want to go back to the country.  Your city life isn't so wonderful after all.  Now, please, help me call a taxi. Moral:  Sometimes other people’s lives are not 
as great as they make you believe. "
"The Dog and his Bone [A version of the tale by TheFableCottage.com] A dog is walking down the street, 
when he sees a bone in a trash can. “A bone! Yippee! How lucky for me!” he thinks. He grabs the bone, and happily runs home. He runs past the train station and the school. He runs through the park. He runs onto a bridge. On the bridge, the dog looks down into the 
deep, still water below.  There, he sees another dog with a bone in its mouth. “Who is that dog?” he wonders. ""What is he doing down there?"" The dog stares at the other dog.  The other dog stares back. “Where did that dog get such a BIG bone?” 
the dog wonders. ""Why is his bone bigger than mine?"" The dog growls at the other dog.  The other dog growls too. “I want that big bone!” he thinks.  The greedy dog decides to steal the other dog's bone.  He leaps off the bridge and into the water.  Splash! But as soon as he hits the water, the other dog disappears. There was never any other dog.  It was just his own reflection!  The water is very deep and the dog is surprised. “Woof woof woof! Help!” he barks.  And when he barks, his bone drops from his mouth — and sinks to the bottom of the water.  The dog swims to shore. He is wet and cold,  and now he has no bone at all. Moral: Be happy with what you have.  If you're greedy, you might lose everything."
"The Wind and the Sun (A version of the tale by TheFableCottage.com) The wind and the sun are having a disagreement.&nbsp; “I am the most powerful!” says the wind. “No, I am the most powerful!” says the sun. “I can blow trees to the ground!” brags the wind. “I can push ships across the ocean. I can make hurricanes and tornadoes!”&nbsp; “Is that right?” replies the sun.  “Well, I can melt all the snow on the mountains.  I can dry up an entire lake. I can make a sidewalk so hot  that it cooks an egg!” Just then, they see a man walking 
along the road in his winter jacket . “Let’s have a contest to see who 
is more powerful,” says the wind. “Whoever can remove the man’s jacket first wins.”&nbsp; The sun agrees. The wind goes first. He blows a gust of cold wind at the man.&nbsp; The man shivers and zips up his jacket. “Brrr! What a cold and windy day!”&nbsp; It starts to rain.  The wind blows even harder and 
turns the rain into snow. “Well look at that! It’s snowing!” says the man.  “Snow wasn’t in the weather forecast today...”  He pulls his hood over his head. The wind blows his strongest gust towards the man, but the man’s jacket stays on.  ""Hmm. It’s a bit fresh today…” he says.  “A winter storm must be coming..."" He zips the jacket higher to cover his nose. “Gah! This is impossible,” says the wind. He stops blowing. “My turn!” says the sun.&nbsp; First the sun shines enough to stop the snow. The man unzips his hood. Then the sun pulls the clouds apart 
and gently shines down on the man. Suddenly, it is a beautiful spring day. “Wow. The weather sure is strange 
around here!” says the man. He unzips his jacket.&nbsp; The sun gently wiggles her fingers 
and increases the temperature.&nbsp; “What strange weather. Now it feels like summer!” the man says as he begins to sweat.  ""Goodness me, it's so hot!""  He removes his winter jacket. He lies down on the grass for a 
nap in the warm sun. ""I win!"" says the sun, beaming.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moral:  Sometimes warmth and gentleness can 
achieve more than strength and force."
"The Frightened Lion (A version of the tale by TheFableCottage.com) One night, Lion is getting ready for bed. He reads his favorite bedtime story and sings his favorite bedtime song.  He turns on his night-light. Then — he hears a sound...  Tap! … Tap! ""What’s that sound?” he whispers. Tap! … Tap! ""That sound… it’s coming 
from outside the window!”   He climbs out of bed. He grabs a baseball bat and tip-toes towards the window. Tap! Tap! Tappity-tap! TAP! “It’s a monster!” he thinks. He grabs his bicycle helmet and 
puts it on his head for protection. He hears the sound again... TAP! ... TAP! … Tappity-TAP! Lion panics.  “The monster is getting closer! It sounds like the BIGGEST, 
SCARIEST monster ever!” Tap! ... Tap! ... Tappity-tap! TAPPITY-TAP! TAPPITY-TAPPITY-TAPPITY…. TAP!  ""EEEK!"" Lion squeals. He runs away from the window

in his hands, and…. Tappity tap! ... A little frog jumps up on the window sill. The frog is wearing a tutu and tap shoes. She dances a little dance. Tap tap tappity tap! ""Hello Lion! Are you in there?” says the frog. She looks through the window and sees Lion hiding under the bed. Lion is wrapped in a blanket…   wearing a bicycle helmet …  ... and holding a baseball bat. He looks ridiculous.  (And to be honest, he feels ridiculous too.) ""Ummm… I have some new dance moves 
to show you,"" says the frog.  ""But you look busy. I will come back later. See ya!"" The frog hops down to the ground 
and happily dances away. Tap-TAP! Tappity-tappity-TAP! Moral: Sometimes our imaginations make 
things scarier than they really are."
"The Little Red Hen (A version of the tale by TheFableCottage.com) This is a story about a little red hen. The little red hen lives on a farm.  She works hard all day long:  She pecks the ground.  She looks for worms. She sits in a bush. And sometimes… she lays an egg.  The little red hen has three friends:  A cat A dog And a horse. These animals don’t work hard at all. The cat likes to sleep in the sun. The dog likes to sleep in the shade. And the horse likes to 
watch TV all day long.   One day the little red hen 
sees a raspberry bush. Raspberries!” she squeals. “Yum yum yum! 
We can make a raspberry cake!” The little red hen runs to tell her friends. “Guys! There are raspberries over there! We can make a raspberry cake!” The dog drools. ""Yes!"" The cat licks her lips. ""Absolutely!"" The horse flicks his tail. ""What a great idea!"" So… who wants to help me pick the raspberries?” 
asks the little red hen. “Not me,” says the dog, “I’m too busy.” “Not me,” says the cat, 
“I’m too tired.” “Not me,” says the horse, 
“I’m watching TV.” ""Then I will do it myself,” 
says the little red hen.  So she picks the berries, one by one, 
all by herself.  ""Ok, now we need flour, and sugar, and milk, and butter,""
says the little red hen. “Who wants to help me get them?” “Not me,” says the dog, 
“I’m too busy.” “Not me,” says the cat, 
“I’m too tired.” “Not me,” says the horse, 
“I’m watching TV.” “Then I will do it myself,” 
says the little red hen. She goes all the way to the pantry 
and gets the flour and the sugar. She goes all the way to the fridge 
and gets the butter and the milk.  Then she puts everything together into a big bowl, 
all by herself.  “Who wants to help me mix the cake batter?” 
asks the little red hen.  “Not me,” says the dog, 
“I’m too busy.” “Not me,” says the cat, 
“I’m too tired.” “Not me,” says the horse, 
“I’m watching TV.” “Then I will do it myself!” 
says the little red hen. She mixes the batter until it is 
smooth and creamy. Then she gently stirs through the raspberries.  She pours the batter into a cake tin. Then she puts it in the oven. 
All by herself.  (Tick tock, tick tock) Soon there is a delicious smell 
coming from the kitchen. The dog can smell it. The cat can smell it. The horse can smell it too.  They all rush to the kitchen. The little red hen takes the cake from the oven.  She puts it on a plate and sprinkles it with sugar.  “So… Who wants to help me eat this cake?” 
asks the little red hen. “Me!” Says the dog.  “Me!”  Says the cat.  “Me!” Says the horse.  “I don’t think so,” says the little red hen.   “You would not help me make this cake…  
so you will not help me eat it.”  She runs away with the cake 
and eats every last crumb. All by herself. "
"The Bear and the Bee (A version of the tale by TheFableCottage.com) Everybody knows that bears love honey. One day Mr Bear looks in his cupboard 
and he can't find any honey.  ""Oh no! No honey!"" he says.  So he goes into the forest to find some.  He sees a beehive in a tree. He smells the honey. ""Mmmmm! Honey!"" He sticks his paw into the beehive and… ZZZZZZZZZ!  A bee flies out. “Hey, bear! Go away!” says the bee. ""This is not your honey!"" Mr Bear is annoyed.  “I am bigger than you,” he says. “And I am stronger than you too.  I can do what I want! Now... buzz off!”  Mr Bear sticks his paw into the beehive again and… ZZZZZZZZZ!  ZING!   OWIE! The bee stings him right on his nose! “My nose! My nose! Oooh... I'm so angry!"" growls Mr Bear. He finds a big stick. He tries to hit the bee.  He swings and he swings, 
but the bee is too fast!  Mr Bear gets angrier and angrier. ""GARRRRRGHH! I WILL SQUASH YOU! 
COME HERE!"" The bee flies back into the beehive. ""AH HAH! Now you're trapped!"" yells Mr Bear.  He swings his stick at the beehive. Smash! Smash! Smash!  He smashes it to pieces!  Then he hears a strange sound. It gets louder and louder…  ZZZZ! ZZZZ! ZZZ! Zzzz! 
ZZZZZZZZZZ! Zzzz! ZZZZ!  Thousands of bees fly out 
of the smashed beehive.  They fly around Mr Bear's head…  ZZZZZZZZZ… ZING! 
They sting him on his ear.  ZING ZING! 
They sting him on his elbow.  They chase Mr Bear through the forest.  They sting him on his arms, 
his legs, his hands... ... and especially on his nose.    ZING! ZING! ZING!  Mr Bear runs all the way home 
and slams the door shut. BAM!  Then he hears a voice behind him. It’s Mrs. Bear.  “You did it again, didn’t you?” she says. “You lost your temper.” “Yes,” he says as he cries 
and counts his bee stings. “Here’s the bee-sting medicine,” 
says Mrs. Bear.  “Also, we have honey in the cupboard. It’s behind the flour.” Moral: A hot temper always 
gets you into trouble."

"the Serengeti plains East Africa 1.3
million animals are about to embark on the most epic migration on earth the
single greatest mass movement of land mammals on the planet as they chase the
African storms in search of rain ripened grass with a journey fraught with danger more meat-eaters hunt to kill or
scavenge these savannas than almost anywhere else in Africa and whenever the
herds arrived they Herald a frenzy of feeding unparalleled in nature this is Africa's great wildebeest
migration as you've never seen it before the halcyon days for Africa's predators Tanzania Central Africa a seasonal storm
clouds have watered the vast grass plains of the southern Serengeti they've
brought the grasslands to life and ushered in the greatest concentration of
grazing animals on the planet yet the 1.3 million wildebeest haven't
come just for the lush grasslands it's early spring and one of the most
significant events in the wildebeest calendar is about to take place wildebeest birth is a quick process
this is a dangerous time for both mother and her unborn calf with one last push a
new runner joins the herd over the next three short weeks around a quarter of a
million cars will be born 90% of all the births of the year with five hundred
born every hour this must be one of the world's greatest population explosions world--as beasts calves learn to stand
faster than any other mammals the lives depend on finding their feet as quickly
as possible within just one day the calf will match
his mother for speed and agility it's an ability written in its DNA as from now
on it will be running for its life in the greatest race on earth around a quarter of those trials when
survived their first year and the migration to come
they're on the hit list of nearly every African predator many calves don't even make it to the
start of the great race this car probably suffocated on its first and
final journey into the herd on the plains of Africa nothing goes to
waste with a wingspan of two and a half meters the lappet-faced vulture is the
largest scavenger here wings outspread in what is known as a threat walk the
bird VARs the carcass from its competitors only when they've made an
opening will the Griffon and white bat vultures or the marabou storks get a
look-in they'll make quick work of the carcass and by dusk little will remain
of the remains the grim end to a short life the diffused light of dawn reveals
another tragedy a lioness has killed an adult ball in the night and concealed it
in the shade of an acacia tree it's no coincidence that the Lions of
the short grass Plains in the southern sound getty choose this time to raise
their young - and judging by the size of their bellies her cubs haven't missed
out on the meat course either the mother wildebeest now form nursery herds where
the calves can learn to play play is good practice for the migration to come
but they never stray too far from their mothers a wildebeest calf is reliant on
its mother for food protection and guidance throughout its first year the soils in the southern San getti are
richer in calcium potassium sodium and phosphorus than anywhere else on the
wildebeest migration route absorbed by the grass and passed on to the calf
through the mother's milk these minerals help build strong bones and muscles this
concentration of minerals may be one of the reasons why the wildebeest choose to
give birth on these short grass Plains in the first place the grassland is now
being grazed hard and the byproduct is something that one
enterprising animal has evolved to exploit dung the wildebeest herd drops
an estimated 420 tons every day there are over 100 different species of dung
beetle in the Serengeti they spend their days on the lookout for fresh droppings
when they find them they fly in and build a ball standing on its head it'll
roll are done away with its back legs these amazing animals move up to 75% of
all the dung dropped on the sound getti and 20% of the soil here is fertilized
by buried balls an underground ladder of food for the beetle and its grubs there
it seems a smaller beetle is intent on stealing from its rivals ball
without dung beetles the Serengeti would quickly become unlivable throughout the
spring the wildebeest herds stock up on the grasses of the southern San getti
but they never really stop moving as they scour the plains for fresh pasture
and it's this gradual urban flow of animals that ultimately ushers in the
great migration there's no set start time and no set route but gradually an
incredible 90% of all the grazing animals that once filled the short grass
plains of the South move on wildebeest has scent glands in their
feet so head down it's a relatively simple process to follow the leader an epic journey that will take the
wildebeest up to a thousand miles has begun and for the next two months
they'll barely stop walking it's now midsummer and after 60 days on
the move the animals have reached a turning point in their migration the
plains are awash with testosterone as the wildebeest prepare to meet charging
at full speed the Bulls butt heads and establish their dominance rutting is
such an all-consuming test of stamina strength and endurance that over the
next three weeks the Bulls may not feel at all mating
itself takes just a few seconds yet wildebeest have one of the most
successful sexual practices of any mammals and despite its brevity an
estimated 95% of females will become pregnant during the rut in the process
the strongest males have ensure their genes are the ones passed on to the next
generation of migrants the wildebeest migration around Africa's
Serengeti is the most awe-inspiring natural event on the planet
1.3 million animals on an endless March it's now late summer and the worldA
beasts have reached the northern border of Tanzania gateway to the lush
grassland of Kenya's Masai Mara but one obstacle lies in their path the
mighty maha-rathah there are no easy folding points here
the water flooded Rapids deep fast flowing and filled with crocodiles the riverbanks cliffs up to 20 meters
high it's a seemingly impenetrable barrier
and for many days the herds are mass on the bank soon tens of thousands of animals line
the water's edge as pressure on the bank continues to build there's nowhere left
to run the animals jostle for space and a calf is pushed over the edge the rest
follow and the Stampede is on there's no stopping them now launching
headfirst into the river the wildebeest take the plunge a high jump gives the ruler based a head
start a dive in that might help them avoid the attention of crocodiles who
could be lurking beneath the water along the shore the current is powerful and the herd are
pushed downstream but wildebeest a strong swimmers with a vigor to make it
across a hippo defends her territory and her
calf this is her River hippos don't like having their space invaded bigger threats lurk beneath the surface the Marez home to some of the largest
crocodiles in Africa the frontrunners of the herd have now
reached the other side but the bank is rocked and as slippery as ice it's
turning treacherous and the animals struggle to make it out there will be many rivers to cross
during their stay in the Masai Mara but for now
soaking and exhausted the wildebeest emerged triumphant onto the green
savanna this is what they've been marching for a
promised land Nirvana for African wildlife the Masai Mara is so productive
at this time of the year that from late summer through autumn the animals will
stay put stock up and regain their strength on the most prevalent plant
here grass each grazer has evolved its own way of feeding on it
and the Mara's predators have evolved their own ways of hunting them zebra
with their rounded mouths graze on the main parts of grass the tall and fibrous
upright shoots like hey they have evolved very acute senses of smell and
vision and that means predators must use stealth to catch them wildebeest don't compete with zebra for
food they use their flat wide mouths to graze deeper and on finer shoots cutting
the grasses off right at ground level around 150,000 Thomson's gazelle
complete the migration each year alongside the wildebeest they don't
compete with a larger grazers for food because with their delicate mouths they
can fish out the chutes the others leave behind their small size does make them
appealing prey though and one of Africa's big cats has evolved its own
way of catching them cheetah may be the fastest animals on land but it's a close
race and the fastest most agile gazelles can survive the chase starting or leaping into the air is a
way for other gazelles to tell the cheetah they've seen it too so there's
no point in pursuing them gazelle calves could never outrun a cheetah so instead
they lie down lie still and hide in the grass it doesn't always work there is one grazer here that few
predators would attempt elephants they'll use their feet to kick up great
pods of grass brushing the soil away before eating the plants roots and all the Mara's grazers coexist thanks to the
different ways they feed and the result is perhaps the most diverse assemblage
of large animals on the planet rain is the essence of the world of East
migration the driving force of that Great Trek Masai Mara received more rain
than anywhere else on route averaging over one metre per year most of that
water falls in the three-month period when the migration is in termed this is
the Mara's wet season a single thunderstorm can bring over five
centimeters of water that little shelter so the animals line up facing away from
the deluge all that water has to go somewhere and
the result is a series of Brooks and streams that crisscross the plains
tributaries of the Mara River they form homes for pods of hippos although not as fast-flowing wide or
deep as the mighty mara for the wildebeest approaching water like this
italic river is always risking their safety in numbers
so the herd waits to reach critical mass before crossing they graze oblivious to
the danger on the other bank lions urged on by instinct a few animals take
their first tentative steps across the water one of last year's cars is taken this truly is nature red in tooth and
claw the calf still kicking while the lioness feeds finally a death grip to the muzzle and
the wildebeest is suffocated out of his misery the herd run off they can never
be sure whether there are other Lions in the area for a lone lioness only one in
five hunts is ever successful yet working together they can bring down
their quarry a third of the time they are now gorge they'll consume up to a
quarter of their own bodyweight in flesh in one sitting they must eat fast in
lion society it's the king that rules and the male and the rest of the pride
are not far behind he's a third larger and a third heavier than the lionesses
and he'll take the lion's share only when the Mail's finished feeding
will they return to the carcass for the wildebeest hard there's no time
to rest lions are just one of the dangers they
must face the Masai Mara is home to what could be one of the highest densities of
big predators found anywhere in Africa and they've all evolved their own
specialized ways of dealing with the bonanza of food
the wildebeest represents cheaters these three brothers have been
patrolling the Mara for the last three years
male cheaters often form alliances for life their territory stretches across
large sways of the Maasai Mara and they'll cover tens of kilometers in a
day on patrol they do have favorite spots vantage points from where they can
survey the plains here there rest and leave scent markings and droppings on
promontories signposts telling other cheetahs they're in the area with no herds in sight the tria relaxed as the Sun sets over the Mara other
predators are on the prowl spotted hyena they choose the dim confusion of dusk to
switch from reputable scavenging to coordinated hunting hyena are the most
numerous big predators on the Mara their clans can reach 80 animals strong and
this strength in numbers ensures a kill almost every night they circle the
wildebeest looking for their best chance hyenas have an extremely well developed
sense of smell and hearing an excellent night vision they're on the lookout for
the sick starving or weakest individuals one hyena breaks away the hunt is on he dies into the herd
singling out one of this year's cars hyenas may travel 50 miles from their
den in search of food and when hunting their endurance is key to their success
their victims unable to keep up with the hyenas staying power end up being run to
exhaustion the calf is driven into the open here
the rest of the clan is waiting hyenas have the strongest bite of any
mammals and can easily chew their way through solid bone the carves fate
seemed sealed then something incredible a hyena from a rival clan bears down on
the prey the pack breaks away hyena won't tolerate a rival on their patch
and they can always catch another calf battered bruised and no doubt terrified
the calf staggers to its feet and races off to rejoin the herd it's been a close
shave the early morning light of dawn reveals the hyena were lucky in the
night they managed to bring down another wildebeest calf now they've got to keep it jackholes
vultures marabou storks are always on hand to steal what morsels they can but
they're our biggest scavengers on the lookout this morning a young male lion
his pride hasn't been so successful and they're hungry in a reverse of popular perception the
Lions now turn scavenger and attempt to drive the hyena off their kill it's a
standoff the lion may be the biggest cat in
Africa but faced with overwhelming numbers they stand little chance of
stealing the kill away the three male cheetahs haven't moved far from their
vantage point in the night and they're hungry
cheetahs usually hunter learn for small prey but working as a team this trio
hoped to secure something much larger the hard edges ever closer to the
Cheetahs the three crouch down like runners on the starting blocks hiding in
the just low enough grass heads down waiting for the wildebeest to approach
the cats play cat and mouse on a large scale a waiting game they hope I still
lie hidden keep watching and let the prey come in
a lone cheater would have little chance against an adult wildebeest it weighs
more than all three cheetahs put together so team Worth is the only way
to success the wildebeest come within range the
cheetah ready for the sprint it may have looked chaotic yet slowed
down the hunt had almost military-like precision first snipers perfectly still
they keep watch singling out their target second springing from the ground
like lethal mortar bombs they cause panic and chaos in the herd cheetah are
the fastest animals on land and can accelerate from nought to 50 in just
three seconds third - cheetah spit mother from calf separating them while
the third cheetah aims for the kill deftly tripping the car for this front
paw yet the wildebeest aren't without defense the mother charges in risking
her own life to save her calf back on its feet
it's running for its likes the second and third sheet are now returned once
more separating the wildebeest and isolating the car
to aid its sprint the Cheetahs feet are equipped with blunt claws that act like
spikes on running shoes unique amongst all counts the drawers can't be
retracted into a sheath instead they're always out and read it around and game
over once the prey is on the ground its fate is sealed death by asphyxiation cheetahs may be the fastest animals on
land but there's a drawback to that speed it raises their body temperature
to near fatal limits as mussels produce heat 60 times that of a cheetah at rest
panting helps the cats cool off in large numbers
vultures can intimidate cheaters of their kills having had their fill
they'll move off in search of water and shade scavengers will waste little times
tripping what's left of the carcass the cat's paused to clean off the blood
of victory it's been a successful morning wildebeest are built to walk and
the truth is their migration never really ends instead they track a path
around the Serengeti in pursuit of Africa's rain ripened grass and as the
seasonal rains move south the herds must follow and that means once again
crossing the Mara River year after year the wildebeest have
chosen one spot to cross as they move the Maasai Mara the most direct route
sites getting restless agitated they start to approach the water nervously tentatively they edged forward
sniffing the ground as if checking for crocodiles the zebra our first to go in they have
more acute senses in the world of East and often lead the way at crossings the wildebeest follow this is what the crocodiles have been
waiting for they seemed to select particular animals
those of the edge of the part of favorite like torpedoes
they homed in on the weak injured or young cars their strategy used their own
body weight to drag their unfortunate victims under and trail crocodiles have the strongest bite of
any animal an incredible crushing force of 340 atmosphere per square centimeter
compared to just ten from air and measuring six meters
they're totally hostile the calf's oblivious to the danger until
it's too late and still the herds keep coming the
forward momentum of the crossing draws the remaining animals off the plains
a lioness the herd is spooked the lioness won't risk an attack until
the wildebeest are within 10 meters but now she has a chance the cough is taken down and dragged into
the scrub the Stampede continues the animals
running in chaos like a shoal of fish will to be seen to know that the middle
of the herd is the safest place to be and jostle for safety using the low
scrub for cover another predator a leopard approaches leopards are stealth
hunters masters of surprise ambush is their way of life and chaos their best
chance grabbing the calf by the neck she bites down on its windpipe and tightens
her grip at 45 kilos she weighs a little less
than the calf which is much much stronger and more agile she uses her
body weight to grapple a car to the ground now with surgical precision
she crunches at the neck crushing the wildebeests windpipe with a turn of her
head she blocks the Airways one last spasm and death takes a grip on
the calf leopards are among the smallest members
of the big cat family so to prevent a kill from being taken by lions hyena or
other scavengers she now drags it away to a safe hiding place in the other
river back in the river it's bedlam as tens of
thousands of animals try to make it up on to the other side the banks are steep
and slippery and there are few places where the animals can make it out the river is so packed with wildebeest
even the crocodiles can't get out of the way yet still the hunt is on the zebra herd have made it across the
crocodiles approach one zebra panics and tries to head
downstream but there's no way out down there trapped by a vertical slippery wall of
mud the lone zebras fate seems sealed on the bank above the rest of the zebra
herd wait brain watching a fallen tree blocks the Zebras path the waters deep it's tired it can barely
keep its head above the surface in just a few days of river crossings
over 10,000 animals can die most are not taken by the lions leopards or Crocs
that trampled on drowned or simply died of exhaustion trying to find their way
out of the water then somehow the zebra finds a way
through and up the bank to the waiting herd the crossing point is quieter yet it's
littered with the remains of the dead the Predators feed on the spoils this
may be the last easy meal they'll have until the herds return in a year's time in the water the Crocs are feeding to
crocodiles have no chewing teeth so they work together taking it in turns to hold
the carcass or rolling to rip off chunks of flesh
there's swallow it whole a crocodiles stomach acid is one of the strongest
found in any animal strong enough to dissolve bone and they could consume half their own
body weight in food in one sitting they'll make do with fish for the rest
of the year now the wildebeest have gone back south
on the bank above the cub has joined the leopard mother she stashed her kill at
the base of a tree and it's time for them to feed the cub is too young to
hunt for himself but he'd investigate the carcass and play whilst the mother
eats clay helps him learn how to kill the herds have started their long march
south back to their birthing grounds on the short grass plains in the southern
Serengeti it's an epic journey that's been repeated for perhaps a million
years but for how much longer in 2010 the government of Tanzania revisited
plans to build a major road across the Serengeti"
"everyone needs a place to live but some&nbsp;
aren't happy with the great outdoors&nbsp;&nbsp; they look for some home comforts these animals have a few tricks&nbsp;
up their sleeves they make homes and there are even a few with&nbsp;
extraordinary building skills for some animals a home address might&nbsp;
be the huge grasslands of East Africa where they must face a multitude of predators and are permanently exposed&nbsp;
to the hardships of weather&nbsp;&nbsp; this is the grim reality of outdoor&nbsp;
living extremes of wet and cold or the baking heat of the desert living in the wild is tough and&nbsp;
most animals just grin and bear it&nbsp;&nbsp; or take whatever shelter they can get&nbsp;&nbsp; but there are a few construction experts&nbsp;
that try to make life more comfortable for&nbsp;&nbsp; themselves by changing their environments&nbsp;
they build homes the most basic of these&nbsp;&nbsp; are simple crevices and caves for a lobster a&nbsp;
cave provides a wall to keep its back against&nbsp;&nbsp; useful protection from the many large&nbsp;
predators hunting for a shellfish dinner positioned outwards any attacker will face its&nbsp;&nbsp; powerful claws this design&nbsp;
of home is basic but popular bears are one of the biggest animals to&nbsp;
exploit natural crevices sloth bears are&nbsp;&nbsp; pretty hard to pin down to a fixed address&nbsp;
they roam large areas in an endless search&nbsp;&nbsp; for food but when they've had enough of&nbsp;
India's fierce Sun they simply pick a&nbsp;&nbsp; shady spot lifesaving caves where they&nbsp;
can chill it can take a while to find a&nbsp;&nbsp; cave of the right size not too warm not&nbsp;
too cold and with a comfortable bed but&nbsp;&nbsp; once they do a cave offers respite they&nbsp;
are not the only ones to share the idea bats for creatures that like&nbsp;
hanging around the walls and&nbsp;&nbsp; ceiling caves offer the perfect&nbsp;
roosts to hide away during the day they navigate the caves using echolocation&nbsp;
listening to the echoes of their high-pitched&nbsp;&nbsp; squeaks bouncing off the rock face without the&nbsp;
cover these small mammals would be vulnerable to&nbsp;&nbsp; predators and never more so than when raising&nbsp;
their fragile young Mongoose also hide out in&nbsp;&nbsp; the caves luckily the bats are high enough to&nbsp;
be out of reach of the agile little predators&nbsp;&nbsp; the desire to seek shelter is instinctive to&nbsp;
most animals and natural shelters are great&nbsp;&nbsp; but you can't always count on finding one when you&nbsp;
need it so some have learned to make their home a master digger aka field cricket this five&nbsp;
centimeter bug has attitude he tunnels a&nbsp;&nbsp; retreat from predators and bad weather&nbsp;
but with his powerful super-sized front&nbsp;&nbsp; legs he makes the opening wider&nbsp;
constructing a huge amplifier field crickets spend most of their time&nbsp;
at home so it's not easy to hook up with&nbsp;&nbsp; friends in order to breed he needs to&nbsp;
advertise his location he rubs modified&nbsp;&nbsp; ridges on his wing cases together thanks to&nbsp;
his enlarged front door the song rings out normally the music would draw potential mates but&nbsp;
this time what it brings is trouble another male to secure this patch and his potential&nbsp;
girlfriends he has to fight but a wise&nbsp;&nbsp; digger keeps close to home keeping his&nbsp;
back to the wall he stands his ground crickets don't see eye to eye and prefer to&nbsp;
work alone but other insects have managed&nbsp;&nbsp; to join forces and are capable of&nbsp;
creating some of the planet's most&nbsp;&nbsp; impressive homes hands of tireless workers&nbsp;
that have vast and complex societies where&nbsp;&nbsp; each individual is born to serve&nbsp;
a role for the good of the colony for most of the thousands of&nbsp;
workers their sole purpose in&nbsp;&nbsp; life is to build and to maintain the home it can be a dangerous job to be on the&nbsp;
construction site working out in the open they&nbsp;&nbsp; are easily picked off by a woodpecker that needs&nbsp;
to gather food for his endlessly hungry chick another creditor appears on the scene but the Jay has different intentions by now that&nbsp;
guard ants are on the scene and raised they spray&nbsp;&nbsp; formic acid from their abdomens to keep Marauders&nbsp;
at bay but this chemical attack is exactly what&nbsp;&nbsp; the Jay has been looking for the ants will&nbsp;
rid his body of parasites keeping him and&nbsp;&nbsp; his feathers in good shape their honor defended&nbsp;
the ants get back to work all members of the&nbsp;&nbsp; colony have jobs to do whether it's building&nbsp;
for guarding but it's only the founder who&nbsp;&nbsp; is here to breed the Queen constantly tended by&nbsp;
workers she spends her entire life making babies&nbsp;&nbsp; the workers feed her keep her clean and carry&nbsp;
away the eggs which they will diligently care&nbsp;&nbsp; for throughout their infant lives the larvae&nbsp;
will be cleaned and fed they are even moved&nbsp;&nbsp; around the nest to be kept at the optimum&nbsp;
temperature until they finally emerge as&nbsp;&nbsp; worker ants to join the colony's task force the&nbsp;
adults work tirelessly to bring food back to the&nbsp;&nbsp; nest building a larder a food Mountain that&nbsp;
will sustain the colony through tough times&nbsp;&nbsp; they scour the woodland for grubs eating&nbsp;
just about anything they can overpower the hapless caterpillar a favorite treat&nbsp;
once prey spotted by a worker chemical&nbsp;&nbsp; signals summoned the troops&nbsp;
to haul it back to the larder but despite their success the&nbsp;
forests can be a dangerous place when a forest fire tears through&nbsp;
threatening all life the ants are&nbsp;&nbsp; one of the few creatures with a ready-made defense having their complex system of underground tunnels&nbsp;&nbsp; and chambers the ants can escape most&nbsp;
dangers and when a threat flares up in&nbsp;&nbsp; their neighborhood they can escape the&nbsp;
flames safe in their subterranean bunker when the fire passes they are the first to emerge&nbsp;
untouched to make the most of others misfortune insects can be accomplished builders their works&nbsp;&nbsp; of art would make any architect jealous&nbsp;
Hornet smash wood to make a paper pulp&nbsp;&nbsp; to create their works of art while&nbsp;
others prefer more robust materials bumblebees share the social skills of&nbsp;
ants tunneling to create safe nurseries secreting wax from their bodies&nbsp;
they can build nesting chambers&nbsp;&nbsp; to protect the eggs and food&nbsp;
stores where pollen and nectar&nbsp;&nbsp; can be stashed by workers to feed the&nbsp;
colony and especially the growing young when the young bees develop the homemade honey&nbsp;&nbsp; pots will feed them until they can&nbsp;
take on corny duties themselves each colony starts with a single female&nbsp;
a queen looking for a suitable hole to&nbsp;&nbsp; start a nest but bumblebees are not the&nbsp;
only home builders tunneling underground bees are not the best bedfellows she plans to take over this ready-made fortress&nbsp;&nbsp; and she's very capable of making her point&nbsp;
but mice are able diggers themselves and&nbsp;&nbsp; the female will quickly build herself a new&nbsp;
nest rodents are among the most accomplished&nbsp;&nbsp; animals when it comes to burrowing and&nbsp;
the European hamster is no exception this female works tirelessly to maintain&nbsp;
her home she lives alone and normally works&nbsp;&nbsp; at night this daytime digging is risky&nbsp;
the Buzzard spots movement in the grass luckily her burrow is 50 centimeters deep keeping&nbsp;
her well out of reach it has multiple chambers a&nbsp;&nbsp; food store and even an ensuite toilet but it's&nbsp;
in the main chamber where her real treasure is&nbsp;&nbsp; stored for their first few weeks the young&nbsp;
have been confined to the nesting chamber&nbsp;&nbsp; living off their mother's milk but gradually&nbsp;
they are moving on to solid foods and putting&nbsp;&nbsp; a dent in their mums food store they mostly eat&nbsp;
seeds and nuts and the female must make regular&nbsp;&nbsp; trips to top up on the larder she makes&nbsp;
a speedy drop-off and heads out for more the more food she gathers the further&nbsp;
she has to walk from the nest this busy&nbsp;&nbsp; period of the mother's life is fraught with&nbsp;
dangers this time a kite hears the rustling with the mothers intensive feeding regime it takes&nbsp;&nbsp; only a month for the youngsters to&nbsp;
be old enough to venture outside female hamsters reach sexual maturity of&nbsp;
just 43 days old so they'll soon need to&nbsp;&nbsp; start digging homes of their own this&nbsp;
is a very dangerous time in the young&nbsp;&nbsp; rodents lives when you are this small it often&nbsp;
seems as if the whole world is out to get you this time it's a polecat on the prowl the agile ferret is a capable&nbsp;
digger with a long bendy body&nbsp;&nbsp; perfect for sneaking through tiny rodent towns but it's too late the family have already&nbsp;
moved on a few big animals also create&nbsp;&nbsp; underground retreats the burrowers these&nbsp;
creatures excavate entire family estates badges are so sociable that given enough&nbsp;
space several families may even share the&nbsp;&nbsp; complex system of tunnels and chambers as&nbsp;
the day wanes activity increases in the set though mostly nocturnal the last hours of daylight&nbsp;
give them a head start on the evenings foraging and for the youngsters it's the perfect time&nbsp;
to play normally Badgers pair for life and in&nbsp;&nbsp; the colony only the dominant female will breed&nbsp;
when they first venture outside the Cubs are&nbsp;&nbsp; only two months old they won't be weaned for&nbsp;
another two months but during this vulnerable&nbsp;&nbsp; period not just their parents but other&nbsp;
females in the group will help with child&nbsp;&nbsp; winding even when independent the youngsters&nbsp;
are likely to remain on the family estate a good deal of scratching goes on&nbsp;
living underground has its drawbacks&nbsp;&nbsp; the nests can be ridden with fleas and other pests as night closes in the family set off to&nbsp;
forage night is also the typical hunting&nbsp;&nbsp; time for foxes but this vixen isn't coming&nbsp;
out tonight for nearly two months she'd&nbsp;&nbsp; been carrying a precious cargo but&nbsp;
now at last her little ones arrived though blind deaf and toothless the tiny pups&nbsp;
instinctively look for milk she won't leave&nbsp;&nbsp; their sides for the first few weeks and will&nbsp;
provide nourishing milk for several months for&nbsp;&nbsp; their first four weeks the little ones will know&nbsp;
nothing of the world outside of their earthen home you before long the mother fox is busy hunting not&nbsp;
just to feed herself but her little ones as well&nbsp;&nbsp; the Cubs are growing fast their eyes and ears&nbsp;
are fully developed and they seem keen to test&nbsp;&nbsp; their sharp teeth on each other but their games&nbsp;
are interrupted they are becoming increasingly&nbsp;&nbsp; aware of noises from the outside world curious&nbsp;
by Nature they are compelled to investigate when mum arrives she's marked by a&nbsp;
hungry crowd over the coming months&nbsp;&nbsp; they will learn to hunt and to dig dens&nbsp;
for themselves soon they will set out&nbsp;&nbsp; to establish territories of their own&nbsp;
their nursery den will soon be redundant badges on the other hand past their set from&nbsp;
one generation to the next keeping it going&nbsp;&nbsp; requires a great deal of management but they are&nbsp;
fastidious regularly making the bed bringing out&nbsp;&nbsp; the old nesting material and replacing it with&nbsp;
fresh thanks to this high level of maintenance&nbsp;&nbsp; the family can rest assured there will be a&nbsp;
roof over their heads for generations to come&nbsp;&nbsp; home building can unite whole communities&nbsp;
in meerkat society it's all about teamwork these altruistic Mongoose are always&nbsp;
watching each other's backs which&nbsp;&nbsp; means that others can work on&nbsp;
their accommodation and safety there may be 90 entrances into their&nbsp;
underground city plenty to keep the&nbsp;&nbsp; whole troupe busy right from the moment&nbsp;
the youngsters leave the den they are&nbsp;&nbsp; learning the ropes the most important&nbsp;
lesson of the day is in home design their long claws are ideal&nbsp;
for shifting dirt and when&nbsp;&nbsp; the back-breaking work gets too much they&nbsp;
can swap duties and do a stint on watch and join the evening sun the troupe&nbsp;
enjoy some quality bonding time play&nbsp;&nbsp; helps reinforce their relationships being&nbsp;
united as a group is key to their survival&nbsp;&nbsp; and even while the group socialize&nbsp;
a few dedicated Watchmen stand guard with the dangers of the desert the troop&nbsp;
can never afford to relax its defenses Oh Jackyl a capable predator&nbsp;
it's picked up the meerkats scent to catch one she'll have to take them by surprise but the sharp-eyed sentinels rarely miss a trick with multiple entrances each&nbsp;
meerkat knows the nearest bolt hole now the bunker really comes into its own taking advantage of their complex tunnels multiple&nbsp;
exits and well Barrett chambers the meerkats give&nbsp;&nbsp; their attacker the slip for them a borough is a&nbsp;
fort a storm shelter and above all the family home after a hard day's work&nbsp;
sleepy pups are ready for bed night falls quickly over the African&nbsp;
desert even more dangers lurk in the&nbsp;&nbsp; dark time for meerkats to go underground&nbsp;
the borough's constructed by the clan&nbsp;&nbsp; keep them warm and dry during the cold&nbsp;
desert nights mammals have mastered the&nbsp;&nbsp; art of shoveling dirt but for more refined&nbsp;
construction work the prizes go to the birds these are the masters of treehouse design and though sometimes their building&nbsp;
materials can get the better of them building blocks that fight&nbsp;
back can slow the process but then even once they are under control&nbsp;
you can't always count on teamwork when&nbsp;&nbsp; they plan to lay all their eggs in one&nbsp;
basket it's important to get it right Birds work tirelessly on their nests though&nbsp;
these works of art are only temporary they&nbsp;&nbsp; serve only as a platform where relationships&nbsp;
can be formed and cemented and they provide the&nbsp;&nbsp; nursery to keep eggs and chicks warm and safe&nbsp;
all too soon they are ready to fly the nest perhaps the most extreme location&nbsp;
is chosen by the great dusky Swift built for the air and not land the agile&nbsp;
aerial acrobats use a natural feature as&nbsp;&nbsp; a wall of defense the roaring waterfall will&nbsp;
keep predators from their construction site the birds gather mud and mix it with sticky saliva as ceramic specialists they mold the homemade&nbsp;
clay into bowls that can support the family to decorate the nursery cushioning mosses gathered and before long it blankets a single egg above the Falls a master of grant design&nbsp;
is at work the South American ro pendulum&nbsp;&nbsp; weaves a hanging basket dangling from&nbsp;
the branches it's near impossible for&nbsp;&nbsp; predators like snakes to climb&nbsp;
their way in it's impenetrable&nbsp;&nbsp; from below but there is one team of&nbsp;
home breakers that haunt the canopy the chickens colorful bill is perfect&nbsp;
for penetrating the RO pendulous defenses&nbsp;&nbsp; in the same Amazonian forests harpy&nbsp;
eagles build among the largest nests over a meter across and deep and they get bigger&nbsp;&nbsp; every year as they are rebuilt&nbsp;
and enlarged for each new clutch in their shadows the smallest nest builders&nbsp;
have been busy while the Eagles nests need&nbsp;&nbsp; the support of powerful tree limbs the&nbsp;
hummingbird nest hangs from a single leaf the female has taken just a week&nbsp;
to build the golf ball-sized nest&nbsp;&nbsp; rounded at the edges to stop her baby falling out now she gathers nectar to feed her chick the nest is made of leaves and hair&nbsp;
woven together with spider silk&nbsp;&nbsp; moss and lichens are added to the&nbsp;
outside to camouflage the precious home thanks to the spider silk the nest is&nbsp;
slightly elastic not only easy to repair&nbsp;&nbsp; but it will stretch slightly to accommodate&nbsp;
the rapidly growing chick from construction&nbsp;&nbsp; to the chick leaving home and the nest&nbsp;
being deserted takes less than two months&nbsp;&nbsp; the carefully interwoven grass is built&nbsp;
by a delicate beak are a far cry from the&nbsp;&nbsp; shovel snouts of the puffins these birds&nbsp;
are masters of the sea but clumsy on land they live like rabbits sometimes&nbsp;
even using rabbits burrows or else&nbsp;&nbsp; digging their own with their colorful beaks they still build the nest but in the basement&nbsp;
underground and out of sight of predators it's&nbsp;&nbsp; a good effort but the penguin like birds&nbsp;
are built for swimming not digging they&nbsp;&nbsp; are not the best at home engineering&nbsp;
but other birds are built for the job some need some pretty hardcore hardware&nbsp;
woodpeckers are like living jackhammers the bird's brain is protected by a&nbsp;
built-in crash helmet packed with&nbsp;&nbsp; airbags to help absorb the shock when it&nbsp;
hammers the tree trunk the blow can be&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,000 times the force of gravity tapping&nbsp;
the trunk can help the bird communicate&nbsp;&nbsp; it can expose bugs and grubs to feed on&nbsp;
but it can also construct a hardy home a lot of animals can benefit from their handiwork while birds are the masters of nest building&nbsp;
there are a few mammals that give it a go the&nbsp;&nbsp; Amazon rainforest is full of dangers that&nbsp;
could spell disaster for a family of coati&nbsp;&nbsp; to improve her chances this Mother's built a&nbsp;
nest a safe house where her young family can&nbsp;&nbsp; avoid the dangers of the forest floor nest&nbsp;
building is very rare in mammals especially&nbsp;&nbsp; when it's so bird-like in its design after&nbsp;
about six weeks the youngsters are ready to&nbsp;&nbsp; venture out but the nest is just too cozy so&nbsp;
mum will have to lead the way the forest is&nbsp;&nbsp; packed with climbing frames and full of exciting&nbsp;
smells for the youngsters don't seem too sure to be a successful coati you need&nbsp;
a head for Heights for the smallest&nbsp;&nbsp; members of the litter mums a little more insistent they have got a lot of learning to do but the most&nbsp;
important lesson a coati can never drop its guard at times like this they still need the safety&nbsp;
of a home in the trees even adult coatis built&nbsp;&nbsp; nests to sleep in and before long the babies&nbsp;
are learning to thatch for themselves it's&nbsp;&nbsp; a good effort but in the mammal world there is a&nbsp;
clear king of Homebuilders the industrious beaver this giant rat the size of a golden retriever&nbsp;
has built-in chisels teeth that never stop&nbsp;&nbsp; growing they rub against each other keeping&nbsp;
them razor-sharp for a life of wood work he&nbsp;&nbsp; and his partner mated for life they have a three&nbsp;
kilometer territory and in the heart of it have&nbsp;&nbsp; used their construction skills to build a log&nbsp;
cabin constructed of logs and mud the lodge&nbsp;&nbsp; which can be 10 metres across houses the entire&nbsp;
clan baby beavers are helpless and stay inside&nbsp;&nbsp; for their first month of life mostly looked after&nbsp;
by mum their bigger brothers and sisters stay in&nbsp;&nbsp; the lodge for several years helping out around&nbsp;
the home and even doing some childminding when&nbsp;&nbsp; the youngsters do venture outside their&nbsp;
lessons begin though the adults will be&nbsp;&nbsp; most of the hard graft the kits will copy them&nbsp;
learning life skills as they play when a tree&nbsp;&nbsp; has been recently felled the buffet awaits the&nbsp;
family bark adds fiber to the meal it's a good&nbsp;&nbsp; way to practice woodwork branches not eaten will&nbsp;
be stripped from the tree and moved to the lodge&nbsp;&nbsp; as a winter food store but working outside can be&nbsp;
dangerous wolves are one of their biggest enemies they freeze hoping the danger will pass but when they get too close for&nbsp;
comfort it's easy to give them the slip the lodges entrance is under water to&nbsp;
keep trespassers at bay the wolves will&nbsp;&nbsp; go hungry tonight they're thick Pelt traps a layer&nbsp;&nbsp; of air keeping water from their skin so&nbsp;
when they haul out they are almost dry although a waterproof jacket of this quality&nbsp;
needs a great deal of care and attention mom can wash up while the little ones&nbsp;
enjoy supper few animals can boast such&nbsp;&nbsp; comfortable accommodations but beavers&nbsp;
do more than just build homes they are&nbsp;&nbsp; also landscape gardeners they build dams&nbsp;
to halt the flow of water streams flood&nbsp;&nbsp; creating ponds a moat to protect their home&nbsp;
and a source of lush water plants to eat by retaining water beavers can reduce flood&nbsp;
risks and their tree felling axe like coppicing&nbsp;&nbsp; creating better denser habitats supporting a&nbsp;
whole ecosystem the ponds they create support&nbsp;&nbsp; everything from mosquitoes to moose by keeping&nbsp;
their family safe and creating a habitat for a&nbsp;&nbsp; wealth of other creatures beavers are the&nbsp;
homebuilding Kings apart from one other us did humans learn from the best&nbsp;
observing animal homes of copying ideas we can build almost anything almost anywhere but no matter how good we think we are&nbsp;
animals still seem keen to make improvements perhaps we still have more to learn"

"The Bird and the Whale (An original tale by TheFableCottage.com) Once there was a bird 
who fell in love with a whale. And a whale who fell in love with a bird. The bird loved the whale's beautiful smile. He loved the way she swam through 
the water so gracefully. The whale loved the bird's handsome 
white feathers. She loved to watch him soar 
through the sky. And they both loved to eat 
lots of tiny fish. All summer, the bird and the whale 
met in the bay. They talked and talked. They talked about the moon, 
and the tides,  and the ships on the ocean. The bird told jokes and made 
the whale laugh. The whale sang beautiful songs 
that made the bird cry (even though he didn't know why). ""One day, you could meet my family in the ocean,"" said the whale. ""And you could meet my friends 
on the land,"" said the bird. Everything was perfect. But the world does not stop turning 
just because a bird and whale fall in love.   Summer turned into autumn, and autumn turned into winter. The ocean turned cold, and all the other whales left 
for warmer waters. ""Come with me to warmer waters,"" 
said the whale. ""It’s a wonderful place. It's always warm, and there are 
so many fish to eat."" ""I love to eat fish,"" said the bird.  ""And I love you.  I will follow you anywhere. But first, teach me to be a whale?"" ""Like this!"" said the whale, ""follow me!"" and she dived deep into the water. ""OK!"" said the bird, and he also dived deep into the water. Deeper and deeper he went. ""I'm swimming!"" he laughed.  ""I'm a whale!"" But soon he couldn't breathe.  He returned to the surface, gasping. He tried and tried and tried again, but he ran out of breath every time. ""I don't think a bird can become a whale,"" said the bird. ""Come with me instead! I live up on the cliffs. It's a wonderful place.  It's warm and cosy,  and every morning you can 
watch the sun rise."" ""I love to watch the sun rise,"" said the whale. ""And I love you. I will follow you anywhere. But first, teach me to be a bird?"" ""Like this!"" said the bird. ""Follow me!"" and he flapped his wings 
and soared into the sky. ""OK!"" said the whale. She squeezed her eyes shut 
and flapped her fins, just like the bird. She flapped and flapped, up and down.  Water splashed everywhere! ""I'm flying!"" she laughed. 
""I'm a bird!""   But when she opened her eyes, 
she wasn't soaring in the sky. She was still in the water. She tried and tried and tried again,  but she could not fly. ""I don't think a whale can become a bird,"" 
said the whale. ""But if you can't fly, and I can't swim, 
where can we live together?"" said the bird. ""We will stay here — in the waves!"" 
said the whale. But the bird shook his head sadly. ""You love to swim deep in the ocean,"" he said.  That is your favourite thing to do. You would never be happy here."" The whale sighed. ""And you love to fly and soar into the sky,"" she said. ""That is your favourite thing to do. You would never be happy here either."" And so, because the bird and whale loved each other so much, they said goodbye. But they never forgot each other. Every time the whale saw a bird flying high in the sky, she thought of her bird.  She hoped he was enjoying the skies — just like that. And every time the bird saw a whale 
diving deep in the ocean, he thought of his whale. He hoped she was enjoying the ocean — — just like that."
"Snow White (A version of the tale by TheFableCottage.com) Once upon a time in a kingdom very far away there lived a king and a queen. The king was handsome and kind Everybody loved him. But the real ruler of the kingdom was his wife... — the queen. Before she became queen, she worked in the castle kitchen. She was very poor. But she was also very beautiful, and funny, and very good at Scrabble. So the king fell in love with her, and married her. The king loved the queen very much. But the queen was always afraid that the king would meet someone more beautiful. Luckily, the queen had a magic mirror. The mirror saw everything and knew everything. Every day the queen looked at herself in the mirror, and asked: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the most beautiful of all?” And the mirror replied: You are, my Queen! You are the most beautiful woman in the whole world.” The queen was happy. She knew there was nobody in the world as beautiful as her. But one day everything changed. The queen stood in front of the mirror and asked her usual question. “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the most beautiful of all?” And the mirror replied: “You are very beautiful, my Queen. But the most beautiful woman in the world is… ... Snow White.” The queen was shocked. “Who is this Snow White?” she asked the mirror. “Snow White works in the castle kitchen. She has hair as black as night, lips as red as roses, and skin as white as snow. As of… 8am this morning, she is a wee-bitty-bit more beautiful than you.” “ARRRGGHH!!” yelled the queen. She stomped her feet. She pulled her hair. Then she sat down and sobbed. “I will lose everything!” The queen was afraid, and that fear turned her heart cold and hard. She called a trusted hunter to her room. “Find the girl, Snow White,” she ordered. “Take her far, far away. Take her deep into the woods.” And then the queen looked deep into the hunter’s eyes. “She must never come back.” The hunter found Snow White, and took her into the forest. When they reached the deepest, darkest part of the forest, the hunter stopped. “Go!” he whispered. “Run fast and far and don't ever go home!” Snow White watched the hunter disappear. “Well, I can’t go home now,” she muttered. She looked around at the dark and silent forest. It started to rain. “But I can’t stay here either. Ok feet, let’s go.” Snow White ran and ran. She ran across a stream, up a hill, and down into a dark valley. She ran all morning. By midday her pale skin and rosy cheeks were covered in mud and scratches. By early afternoon her long black hair was full of sticks and leaves. By night, she was not beautiful anymore. She was tired, hungry, and shivering with cold. But then Snow White smelled woodsmoke in the air. She followed the smell and found a cottage in the woods. There was a warm, golden glow from the windows. She knocked on the door. “Hello?” She called out. “Is anyone home?” There was no answer. She pushed the door open and went inside. Inside the cottage were seven tiny beds, seven tiny chairs, and a roaring fire. A big table was covered with dirty dishes. Snow White was very hungry and thirsty. She found some bread, and ate the whole loaf. She found some milk, and drank the whole bottle. Then she sat in front of the fire to get warm. And just like that, she fell asleep. When she woke up, there were seven dwarfs standing around her. Snow White rubbed her eyes. “Who are you?” she said. “This is OUR house!” said one dwarf, angrily. “Who are YOU?” “Shhh, you'll scare her!” said another. “She’s a giant. SHE scares ME!” said yet another. “Can I stay with you?"" asked Snow White. ""It seems I can't go home."" The dwarfs whispered amongst themselves. “Ok,” they agreed. “But only if you help us wash the dishes. We hate washing dishes!” “It’s a deal,” said Snow White. And so, Snow White found a new home with the seven dwarfs. Every morning she washed the dishes. And every morning, as the dwarfs left for work, they said “Be careful. Don’t open the door for anyone... ... And thank you for washing the dishes. We really hate washing dishes.” Back at the castle, the queen was feeling better. She thought Snow White was gone forever. But she was still a little afraid. “Come and play Scrabble with me, my love!” shouted the King from the bottom of the stairs. “You can go first!” “Maybe later, dearest,” replied the queen. She stood in front of her magic mirror. “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the most beautiful of all?” The mirror replied: “You are very beautiful, my Queen. But the girl Snow White is the most beautiful woman in the world.” “Snow White is ALIVE??” shouted the queen. “She is living with the seven dwarfs in the forest,” said the mirror. “Last night, she was not very beautiful. But as of…  1pm today, she is more beautiful than you.” “RATS!” shouted the queen. She went to her closet and got her old coat and old boots. “I’ll have to kill her myself!” She ran out of the palace, jumped into her fastest carriage, and sped off towards the forest. Snow White was reading beside the fire when there was a knock on the door. KNOCK! KNOCK! She peeked through the window. There was a woman holding a basket of fruit. The woman had a beautiful face, but she was wearing an old dress and old boots. “FRUIT! FRESH FRUIT! APPLES AND BANANAS AND PEARS AND ORANGES!” “Oh, I want some fruit…” thought Snow White. The woman saw Snow White through the window. “Hello dear!” said the woman. “Do you want some fruit? I have delicious apples today...” “I love apples…” said Snow White. “But I'm not supposed to open the door for anyone… … those apples might be poisoned.” “Oh, how silly,” said the woman. She cut an apple in half. “Here. You can taste half, and I will eat the other half. That way you know it’s NOT poisoned.” Snow White opened the door. The woman gave one half of the apple to Snow White, and ate the other half. When Snow White saw the woman eating the juicy apple, her mouth watered. She couldn’t stop herself. She took a big bite of the apple. Almost immediately, Snow White fell to the ground. The apple was poisoned, but only on one half! The queen sighed with relief. Quickly, she got back into her carriage and rode back to the castle. When the dwarfs arrived home, they found Snow White lying on the floor. They yelled in her ears. They tickled her feet. They poured cold water on her face. But she didn't wake up. “Is she ... dead?” asked one dwarf. “She doesn’t seem to be alive…” said a second. And so the dwarfs made a glass coffin for their beloved friend. They set it on a table in a beautiful part of the forest, surrounded by flowers. Snow White lay there for over a year: Through spring, summer, autumn, and winter. One day, a prince from a different kingdom was walking through the forest with his dog. He saw Snow White’s strange glass coffin. He brushed off the leaves and saw Snow White inside. Just then, he tripped over his dog and knocked the coffin off the table! Snow White rolled out of the coffin and onto the grass. “Oh no! Oh dear! Oh... fffffffiddlesticks!"" the prince shouted. But then an amazing thing happened: The piece of poisoned apple that was stuck in Snow White’s throat fell out, and she began to cough. The prince rushed to help her. “Apples…” she coughed. “I beg your pardon?” said the prince. “No .. more .. apples!” That night, the queen stood in front of the magic mirror and asked her question. “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the most beautiful of all?” And to her surprise, the mirror said: “You are very beautiful, my Queen. But... Snow White is again the most beautiful woman in the world.” “WHAAAAAAT?????” screamed the queen. And in her anger, she picked up a shoe and threw it at the mirror. The mirror smashed into a thousand pieces, and the magic inside it was released. “NOOOOOOOOOO!” screamed the queen. She collapsed on the floor and fell into a deep sleep. While she slept, the queen had a strange dream. In her dream, she was dancing in hot iron shoes. Her feet burned and burned but she couldn’t stop dancing. When the Queen woke up from this terrible dream, it was morning. The sun was shining, and the Queen felt... ...different. The magic mirror's spell was broken, so she didn't feel anxious or jealous anymore. She felt free. She went downstairs to find her husband. She really wanted to play Scrabble. And what happened to Snow White? The dwarfs were very happy to see Snow White alive. They invited the prince for dinner. When the prince learned that nobody liked washing dishes, he bought them a dishwasher. Everybody lived happily ever after."
"Once upon a time there was a girl named Rapunzel. Rapunzel lived in a tall tower in the middle of a forest. The tower had no ladder no stairs and definitely no elevator There was no way to get up or down. So… why did Rapunzel live in a tower? Well, it all started with a witch. As you know, witches can be very jealous. They especially hate people stealing herbs from their gardens. Unfortunately Rapunzel’s mother didn't know this about witches. Many years ago when she was pregnant with Rapunzel, she snuck over the fence and stole some parsley from the witch next door. The witch saw her stealing parsley. She was furious. She gave Rapunzel’s mother two choices. Option one: The witch would curse her unborn baby girl. The girl would always be unlucky. She would meet the wrong people and say the wrong things and wear the wrong clothes for every occasion She would never live happily ever after. Option two: On the girl’s tenth birthday, she would go to live with the witch. She would be the witch’s apprentice. The witch promised that, eventually the girl would live happily ever after. Rapunzel’s mother was heartbroken. She chose option two. And on the evening of Rapunzel’s tenth birthday the witch came to take her away She put Rapunzel in the tall tower in the woods. After that, every day was the same for Rapunzel. She cleaned her room at the top of the tower. She braided her long, long hair. And every day at lunchtime, the witch came to the tower. She stood under the window and shouted: RAPUNZEL! RAPUNZEL! Let down your hair! Rapunzel threw her braid out of the window. The witch climbed up Rapunzel’s hair like a rope and crawled in through the window The witch taught Rapunzel how to make medicines with herbs. And Rapunzel loved the witch. She was Rapunzel’s only friend. One night, Rapunzel was reading a book beside the window when she heard someone below: RAPUNZEL! RAPUNZEL! LET... DOWN... YOUR HAIR?! “That’s strange,” she thought. The witch never comes this late. She threw her braid out of the window and the person climbed up, up, up. But when this person reached the top Rapunzel saw that it wasn’t the witch. It was a man! Rapunzel quickly grabbed her book and smacked the man on the head. Get out! Get out! You’re not the witch! The strange man fell to the floor. “Ow! Ow! Stop hurting me!” he begged. Who are you? What do you want? Why did you climb my hair? demanded Rapunzel “I’m Justin! My name is Justin!” he whimpered I came here to ... save you? As you can imagine, Rapunzel was not very impressed. “Tell me, Justin,” she growled. Does it look like I need to be saved? Justin sighed. I'm sorry I thought this was my chance to be a hero “What do you mean?” asked Rapunzel. My chance to be hero! Every man needs to be a hero at least once in his life. It’s the only way to live happily ever after! Rapunzel put down her book. “I don’t need a hero,” she said, kindly. Go away. Be a hero somewhere else. It’s late. I want to go to bed. Rapunzel threw her braid out the window. Well, can I come back and talk to you tomorrow? Justin asked you seem nice Also I brought a rope for you In case you change your mind one day... “Fine, fine,” said Rapunzel. Goodbye, Justin And Justin climbed out the window and down Rapunzel's hair The next day, Rapunzel cleaned her room and braided her hair The witch came at lunch time. She brought Rapunzel a sandwich and showed her how to make medicine to cure headaches But as the witch was leaving she saw Justin’s rope lying on the floor Whose rope is this? Where did you get it? Do you want to escape? Rapunzel tried to explain, but the witch was too upset. I love you like a daughter! Do you really hate me so much that you want to leave? “No… there was a man—” said Rapunzel. “A MAN?” the witch cried Fine! Go to him! Go! Tears poured down the witch’s face Go and live happily ever after with this …. man! The witch threw some magic powder at the floor and Rapunzel immediately fell asleep When she woke up, she was not in the tower anymore. She was lying under a tree in the forest. Her hair was cut Rapunzel cried for ten minutes and then she stood up and decided to look for her tower Meanwhile, back at the tower Justin returned as promised Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair! he shouted from beneath the window And the hair dropped down in front of his face But as I’m sure you know... It wasn’t Rapunzel in the tower. It was the witch! When Justin got to the top of the tower the witch pulled him in through the window. ""So YOU are the man who wants to take my Rapunzel!"" she said I see. Well then. Go and live happily ever after together! The witch blew a handful of powder into his face. And with that, Justin was blind. After walking all night, Rapunzel found her way home. But the tower was gone! All that was left was a burnt circle on the ground. “Oh nooooo!” cried Rapunzel and she fell to the ground sobbing But then she heard a voice coming from behind some trees. Hello? Is someone there? Can you help me? I can't see... ... I can't see anything! It was Justin! When Rapunzel saw Justin’s blind eyes, she knew what to do. “Stay right there,” she ordered. Rapunzel ran into the forest to find some herbs. She ground the herbs and made medicine. Then she put the medicine on Justin’s eyes. Then... she cried again “Please don’t cry…” said Justin, softly. Why are you crying? My home is gone. My only friend is gone You are blind — this is a mess! “Everything will be ok,” Justin said. Then he smiled. Trust me — I’m a hero! For three days, they camped in the forest. Rapunzel made medicine for Justin’s eyes. Justin told her about every time he had tried to be a hero. Once he tried to fight a giant... but the giant was very kind He invited Justin inside for tea Once he tried to kill a dragon... But the dragon had baby dragons in its nest. Justin couldn’t do it. Once he rescued a cat from a tree... But the cat immediately climbed back up. “It’s really hard to be a hero!” he complained. When Rapunzel felt like crying, Justin told jokes until she laughed. When she couldn’t sleep, he listened to all her worries. On the fourth day when Rapunzel woke up Justin was already awake He was looking at her with his bright blue eyes He could see! “Thank you, my beautiful friend,” he said You fixed my eyes. Justin and Rapunzel walked to Justin’s village. Rapunzel liked it in the village. Justin helped her build a new tower and this time the tower had stairs Rapunzel spent her days making medicine for the sick people in the village Did Justin ever become a hero? Yes, of course! There are many kinds of heroes But the best and bravest heroes are the ones who help their friends through hard times And Justin had helped his friend Rapunzel In the end Justin and Rapunzel both lived happily ever after — — just as the witch had promised"

and he can't find any honey. ""Oh no! No honey!"" he says. So he goes into the forest to find some. He sees a beehive in a tree. He smells the honey. ""Mmmmm! Honey!"" He sticks his paw into the beehive and… ZZZZZZZZZ! A bee flies out. “Hey, bear! Go away!” says the bee. ""This is not your honey!""

his legs, his hands... ... and especially on his nose. ZING! ZING! ZING! Mr Bear runs all the way home
and slams the door shut. BAM! Then he hears a voice behind him. It’s Mrs. Bear. “You did it again, didn’t you?” she says. “You lost your temper.” “Yes,” he says as he cries
and counts his bee stings. “Here’s the bee-sting medicine,”
says Mrs. Bear. “Also, we have honey in the cupboard. It’s behind the flour.” Moral: A hot temper always
gets you into trouble."
"The Dog and his Bone [A version of the tale by TheFableCottage.com] A dog is walking down the street, 
when he sees a bone in a trash can. “A bone! Yippee! How lucky for me!” he thinks. He grabs the bone, and happily runs home. He runs past the train station and the school. He runs through the park. He runs onto a bridge. On the bridge, the dog looks down into the 
deep, still water below.  There, he sees another dog 
with a bone in its mouth. “Who is that dog?” he wonders. ""What is he doing down there?"" The dog stares at the other dog.  The other dog stares back. “Where did that dog get such a BIG bone?” 
the dog wonders. ""Why is his bone bigger than mine?"" The dog growls at the other dog.  The other dog growls too. “I want that big bone!” he thinks.  The greedy dog decides to steal the other dog's bone.  He leaps off the bridge and into the water.  Splash! But as soon as he hits the water, 
the other dog disappears. There was never any other dog.  It was just his own reflection!  The water is very deep 
and the dog is surprised. “Woof woof woof! Help!” he barks.  And when he barks, his bone 
drops from his mouth — and sinks to the bottom of the water.  The dog swims to shore. He is wet and cold,  and now he has no bone at all. Moral: Be happy with what you have.  If you're greedy, you might lose everything."

walking through the woods.  He is hungry, and he is 
looking for something to eat. He sees a crow sitting on the 
highest branch of a tree. The crow has a piece of cheese

the most beautiful bird,” he says. Your feathers are so shiny!  Your eyes are so intelligent! Your beak is so…umm…  pointy! Everything about you is perfect!” Still, the crow says nothing. So the fox says: “Tell me, Miss Crow… is your voice ALSO magnificent? I hear that you have the

breakfast, Miss Crow!"" laughs the fox as he walks away.  ""Have a lovely day!”  Moral: Beware of flatterers.  They often want something from you."
"The Emperor's New Clothes Once upon a time there was an emperor. He had a big round belly bushy eyebrows and a very long moustache. But he was very vain. All he thought about was himself. “I am so wonderful!” he would say. Look at my wonderful eyebrows! Look at my excellent moustache! I look marvellous! The emperor loved to wear fancy clothes He had four-hundred fancy shirts three-hundred pairs of fancy pants and one-thousand pairs of fancy socks. The emperor also loved to say fancy words, like... ""Empirical"" ""Cantankerous"" ""Discombobulate"" He didn’t know what the fancy words meant but he liked to say them anyway. He liked to sound INTELLIGENT. “I am so INTELLIGENT!” he said. I am a GENIUS! One day, a man arrived at the palace. He said that he was a tailor. He said he could make the fanciest clothes in the land. But really, this man was a dishonest man. He earned his money by fooling rich people. The tailor brought the emperor ten suitcases.
‍ Your most majestic and INTELLIGENT majesty... he said Everybody knows that you are the most INTELLIGENT man in the world. And I have created some amazing new clothes. These clothes are only for INTELLIGENT people. In fact, stupid people cannot even see these clothes... The emperor clapped his hands. Amazing! With these clothes I can know who is smart and who is stupid! I will never be bothered by idiots again! Let me try these clothes! The tailor undressed the emperor until he stood only in his underpants. He unpacked his tape measure. He measured the emperor’s arms legs shoulders and all around his big round belly The tailor reached inside one of the suitcases. No...no... this one is too big. No… this one is too small. Ahh! This one is perfect! He pretended to lift a shirt out of the suitcase. “What do you think?” said the tailor. The emperor gasped. He could not see anything! “Isn’t it wonderful?” said the tailor. And remember… Only intelligent people will be able to see it! The tailor reached into his suitcase again. Look at these pants! Aren’t they beautiful? And they are completely invisible to idiots! And look at this jacket! See the colours? A complete nincompoop will see absolutely nothing! “Oh, oh, yes… very nice!” stammered the emperor. But he was confused. Why couldn’t he see the clothes? “Surely it’s not possible that I am an idiot?!” he thought. A complete moron would not know fancy words like... ""Vestibule"" ""Crepuscular"" ""Flibbertigibbet"" But the emperor said nothing. The tailor pretended to dress the emperor in the invisible shirt, pants, jacket, and shoes. The emperor stood in front of the mirror. He wanted to see the clothes but all he saw was his big, round belly and his underpants ""I’m not sure that it’s really my style…"" said the emperor But let me get a second opinion. The emperor called three of his most INTELLIGENT friends into the room. Friends! What do you think of these new clothes? Only INTELLIGENT people can see these clothes. Stupid people see nothing at all! Of course, his friends didn’t see anything either. But they did not want to look stupid. “Oh, yes! That is a great shirt!” said the first friend. “Yes! The pants are the perfect color,” said the second friend. ""Cool shoes!"" said the third friend. The emperor was excited. I will wear these new clothes in the parade tomorrow! The emperor gave the tailor a lot of money. The tailor left the palace with ten suitcases full of gold. When he was safely in his carriage, he laughed long and hard. ""What a doofus!"" That night, the Emperor did not sleep. He stayed up late, reading the biggest, heaviest books in his library. I just need a few more fancy words... THEN I’ll be able to see my clothes! he thought. In the morning, two servants came to the Emperor's room to dress him for the parade. Of course, they couldn’t see any clothes either. But they said nothing. They did not want to look stupid. They pretended to dress the emperor in invisible pants, invisible shirt invisible jacket and an invisible hat. The emperor looked at himself in the mirror. He stared and he squinted. He turned his head left and right. And … wait! ... There it was! Out of the corner of his eye, he thought he saw a slight shimmering fabric. A checkered pattern. A tiny bit of colour. He could see the clothes! In reality, there were no clothes. But we often see what we want to see. The emperor was happy that he could finally see the clothes. “Let’s join the parade!” he shouted. Everybody from the town was at the parade. All the intelligent people were there: All the scientists. All the writers. All the teachers. And all the children. The emperor stood in his open carriage and waved to the crowd. But as the emperor’s carriage drove down the street, the crowd fell silent. The music stopped. Everybody stared at the emperor. “These clothes must be AMAZING...” thought the emperor. But then, from the back of the crowd, a small child yelled: “Mummy, I can see his underpants!” Everybody gasped. Then there were a few giggles. And then everyone on the street laughed — — and laughed — — and laughed even harder. They clapped and shouted: UN-DER-PANTS! UN-DER-PANTS! The emperor heard the crowd laugh. He knew he had been fooled. He wasn’t wearing special clothes. He was wearing NOTHING! — only his underpants. He jumped out of the carriage and ran all the way back to the palace. Behind him, he heard: “UN-DER-PANTS! UN-DER-PANTS!” He ran to his bedroom and slammed the door. Later, when his friends found him, he was lying on his bed. He was wearing all his REAL clothes: all his fancy shirts all his fancy pants and all one-thousand pairs of fancy socks."

to show you,"" says the frog.  ""But you look busy. I will come back later. See ya!"" The frog hops down to the ground 
and happily dances away. Tap-TAP! Tappity-tappity-TAP! Moral: Sometimes our imaginations make 
things scarier than they really are."
"The Wind and the Sun (A version of the tale by TheFableCottage.com) The wind and the sun are having a disagreement.&nbsp; “I am the most powerful!” says the wind. “No, I am the most powerful!” says the sun. “I can blow trees to the ground!” brags the wind. “I can push ships across the ocean.

turns the rain into snow. “Well look at that! It’s snowing!” says the man.  “Snow wasn’t in the weather forecast today...”  He pulls his hood over his head. The wind blows his strongest gust towards the man, but the man’s jacket stays on.  ""Hmm. It’s a bit fresh today…” he says.  “A winter storm must be coming..."" He zips the jacket higher to cover his nose. “Gah! This is impossible,” says the wind. He stops blowing. “My turn!” says the sun.&nbsp; First the sun shines enough to stop the snow. The man unzips his hood. Then the sun pulls the clouds apart 
and gently shines down on the man. Suddenly, it is a beautiful spring day. “Wow. The weather sure is strange 
around here!” says the man. He unzips his jacket.&nbsp; The sun gently wiggles her fingers 
and increases the temperature.&nbsp; “What strange weather. Now it feels like summer!” the man says as he begins to sweat.  ""Goodness me, it's so hot!""  He removes his winter jacket. He lies down on the grass for a 
nap in the warm sun. ""I win!"" says the sun, beaming.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moral:  Sometimes warmth and gentleness can 
achieve more than strength and force."
"Jack and the Beanstalk (A version of the tale by TheFableCottage.com) Once there was a young man named Jack. He lived with his mother on a small farm
at the foot of the Foggy Mountains. Jack and his mother were very poor. Their only way of making money was
selling the milk from their cow, Bess. One morning, Jack's mother
woke him up early. It was still dark outside. She was crying. ""Jack, wake up! Go to the market today
and sell our cow, Bess."" ""But why?"" asked Jack, yawning. ""We need money to fix our house. There are holes in the roof. The windows are broken. For heaven's sake, we have no front door. Winter is coming soon. If we don't fix the house,
the cold will kill us!"" Jack packed his bag and
fetched Bess from the barn. As he was walking out the gate,
he heard his mother shout: ""She is worth at least five gold coins! Don’t sell her for less!"" When Jack was half way to
the market, he met an old man. ""Good morning, my boy!""
said the old man. ""Where are you going today?"" ""Good morning, sir,"" replied Jack. ""I'm going to the market
to sell my cow. Her name is Bess."" ""She is a beautiful cow,"" said the man. ""I will buy Bess, and I will give you
a very good deal!"" “How much will you pay for her? I won’t take less than
five gold coins!” said Jack. “I don't have five gold coins,"" whispered the man. ""But I have these five black beans! These beans are magic beans!
They are worth more than gold! If you take these beans, you will be
richer than the richest man in the world.” Jack thought about his mother. He thought about how happy
she would be if they were rich. They could fix the roof, the windows,
and the front door. Maybe they could buy a new cow! “Okay,"" said Jack. ""You’ve got a deal.
Give me the beans!"" Jack was very excited. He ran home and showed
his mother the beans. But instead of being happy,
she was furious. “You foolish boy! You traded our
only cow for a handful of beans?!” She took the beans and threw
them out the window. Then she sat down beside
the fire and cried. Jack was devastated. He shut himself in his bedroom. He felt so stupid. They no longer had a cow,
and now they were poorer than before. What a disaster! And it was his fault! The next morning when Jack opened
the curtains, he saw something very strange. In the same place where his
mother had thrown the beans, there was a giant, green beanstalk. It stretched from the ground,
up, up, up… all the way to the clouds. “The beans really are magic!”
whispered Jack. ""The old man was telling the truth!"" Jack's mother was still asleep, so Jack decided to climb the beanstalk
to look for the riches the old man had described. ""Just five gold coins,"" thought Jack. That's all I need to make my mother happy."" Jack climbed up, up, up,
higher and higher into the clouds. When he reached the top,
he was very hungry. He saw a castle in the distance. ""Maybe I can find something to eat
in that castle…"" he thought. Jack walked up to the door of
the castle and knocked twice. Knock knock! A giantess opened the door. She was as big as a house, but she had a warm smile
and gentle eyes. ""Excuse me, Mrs. Giant,"" said Jack. ""Could you please give me something to eat?
I am so hungry!"" ""Oh you poor boy!"" said the giantess. She could see that Jack was very thin. ""Of course! Come in! Come in!"" The kind giantess gave Jack
some vegetable stew. He was enjoying it so much that he didn't
notice when the kitchen table started to shake. Stomp... Stomp... Stomp…
Loud footsteps echoed down the hallway. ""Oh dear,"" whispered the giantess. ""That is my husband!
He is home from work! He doesn't like humans!
Quick! Hide!"" Jack hid in the pantry. The giant stomped into the kitchen
and sniffed the air. ""FEE FI FO FUM! ... Hello my beautiful wife! Wait! Do I smell a human man? YUCK! WHERE IS HE?"" ""Good evening, my darling husband,""
replied the giantess. ""There is nobody here. You smell the vegetable stew,
nothing more."" ""Good,"" grunted the giant. ""I hate humans."" He sat down at the
table in the kitchen. The giant took out a small sack of gold coins
out of his pocket and counted them. One... two... three... four... five gold coins. Jack watched from inside the pantry. ""Five gold coins!"" thought Jack. ""If I had that money, I could fix our house!"" When the two giants left the room, Jack stole the five gold coins
and slipped them into his bag. ""This is all I need!"" thought Jack. But then Jack remembered that
his family no longer had a cow. Without a cow, they would surely starve. He decided to stay and
look for other treasures. He followed the giant into the living room
and hid under the couch. The giant went to the cupboard
and pulled out a golden hen. “Hello, my beautiful hen! Lay, please!"" said the giant,
and the hen laid a golden egg. Jack watched from under the couch. ""A hen that lays golden eggs!""
whispered Jack. ""If I had that hen,
I could buy FIFTY cows!"" When the giant left the room,
Jack crawled out from under the couch. He went to the cupboard, took the hen,
and put it in his bag. ""This is all I need… "" thought Jack. But then Jack thought about
what the old man had promised. Jack imagined being richer than
the richest man in the world. He decided to see what other
treasures he could find. He followed the giant into the bedroom,
and hid under the bed. There was a golden harp standing
in a corner of the room. ""Hello, my beautiful harp. Play, please!""
said the giant. The harp began playing music
with no one touching the strings. ""Wow! A magic harp!"" whispered Jack. ""That harp would make me
rich and famous!"" When the giant fell asleep,
Jack crawled out from under the bed. He took the magic harp
and put it in his bag. But this time Jack was less lucky. The magic harp screamed, “Help me, master!
A human is stealing me!” The giant woke up and saw Jack
with the magic harp, the golden hen, and his gold coins. ""STOP, THIEF!"" The giant chased Jack — — out of the bedroom, down the hallway,
through the kitchen, and out the front door. But Jack was smaller
and faster than the giant. Jack reached the beanstalk first
and slid down. He arrived at the ground
with all his treasures. The giant reached the top of
the beanstalk and looked down. He was afraid of heights. He slowly climbed down. ""BE CAREFUL, MY HUSBAND!""
shouted the giantess from the castle. ""HUMANS CAN BE DANGEROUS!"" Jack saw the giant coming
down the beanstalk. So he ran into his house
and grabbed an axe. He chopped the beanstalk.
Whack! Whack! Whack! Suddenly, the beanstalk snapped. The giant came tumbling down from the sky. He fell down, down, down, and landed far away,
on the other side of the Foggy Mountains. Thud! For a moment everything was silent. Then Jack heard a strange sound
from far away. ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooo!"" It was the giant. The beanstalk had fallen, and now he had no way to get back up
to his castle in the clouds. The giant yelled so loudly that
the clouds shook and turned gray. Then somewhere up in the sky,
Jack heard Mrs. Giant start to cry. Her tears fell through the clouds in tiny drops
and soaked the earth. After that, Jack and his mother
lived a very comfortable life. The golden hen made a Jack a millionaire. The magic harp made him famous. Jack married a rich and famous woman
and together they had ten children. But Jack was never truly happy. Every time the wind blew, Jack heard the giant calling for his wife. And every time it rained, he felt the giant-wife's
tears falling on him. Jack felt sad and guilty. One day, when Jack was very old, he decided that he didn't want
to be sad any more. He opened a box on his mantelpiece and
pulled out one last shrivelled magic bean. If he could find the giant,
he could grow another beanstalk. Then the giant could climb back up
to his castle in the clouds. If he could find the giant, he could also
apologize for being so greedy. Jack packed his bag and walked
into the Misty Mountains. Did Jack find the giant? Did he grow a new beanstalk
with the last magic bean? Nobody knows. But people say, if you listen closely
during a thunderstorm, you can hear the rumbling sound of
two giants dancing together in the clouds."
"The city mouse and the country mouse A version of the tale by TheFableCottage.com This is a city mouse. He lives in a big city with tall buildings 
and lots of shops and restaurants.  But today he is visiting his friend, 
a country mouse.  The country mouse lives in a cozy nest 
at the bottom of a tree. Her home is small, but it is warm 
and comfortable.  The country mouse cooks a dinner 
of food from her garden: corn, carrots, acorns and a cold glass of water from the stream Meanwhile, the city mouse talks and talks: The city is amazing!    I go to the theater and the museum... My house has TWENTY rooms. You absolutely MUST visit!  Have you ever tried Chinese food? That night, the country mouse dreams 
that she lives in the city. She dreams that she eats 
at fancy restaurants, says fancy things, and buys fancy hats from fancy stores. She dreams about eating Chinese food. ""How wonderful!"" she thinks. ""I want to live in the city too!"" The next morning the country mouse 
agrees to visit the city mouse. She packs her bag and follows the city mouse 
back to his big house in the city. The house is enormous! There are TWENTY rooms full of beautiful furniture.  The country mouse is amazed.  ""Which room is mine?"" she asks.  ""Um... we actually live down here…"" 
says the city mouse. He leads her down some stairs 
to the basement. In the darkness, the country mouse 
sees many families of mice. ""These are my housemates…"" 
explains the city mouse.  The city mouse leads the country mouse 
back upstairs for dinner. In the dining room there is a feast of 
delicious foods on the table: cheese, bread, cookies, cakes, and lemonade. There is also… Chinese food!  But just as they start to eat... CRASH! A cat with sharp teeth and sharp claws 
jumps up on the table. REEEEEOWWWW! The city cat chases the two mice 
off the table and across the floor. The mice hide in a hole in the wall.  They are trapped! They wait silently until the cat leaves.  Then, they quietly creep back to the dining room … but all the food is gone!  The city humans ate everything!  The country mouse hurries back to the 
basement and packs her bag.  ""Where are you going?"" asks the city mouse.  ""Home.” she says.  I want to go back to the country.  Your city life isn't so wonderful after all.  Now, please, help me call a taxi. Moral:  Sometimes other people’s lives are not 
as great as they make you believe. "

What about the American presidents? If we know the presidents, then we can understand American history more easily! Wow, that’s a great idea! Starting from the first president, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, the 16th, Franklin Roosevelt, the 32nd, John Kennedy, the 35th, and more. There are many famous ones. That's right. George Washington led the country to victory in the Revolutionary War and is known as ‘the Father of the United States.’ Lincoln was the one who ended the slavery system during the American Civil War. And there is the symbol of liberal democracy, John F. Kennedy. Hmm. But over 40 presidents are just too many. Are there really over 40? What a headache! I don’t think we will ever finish this. Is there any other topic? What about war? Shoo! Shoo! I think that's good too. There are wars that changed American history, such as the American Civil War and the Revolutionary War. We could also talk about World War I or World War Ⅱ. Um… I don’t like the topic of war. It’s about people fighting! Hm. What about how people’s lives changed after the war? Hm. After the Great War, there was the Great Depression. That’s too hard! Then what about this? I have a great idea! What is it? We should start from the beginning of America.

Why did I take a test without any preparation? What? The genius boy Roy ruined an exam? Yes… I got two questions wrong. I think I should be well prepared next time. Hey Kevin, what happened to you? You look really angry. My naughty sister broke my cell phone screen. Look at this! Wow, it’s completely cracked! Your sister? Mary? She looked very quiet the last time I saw her. You don’t know what you are talking about. She is such a troublemaker. I will do something about Mary! Give your phone to a service center. They will repair it quickly.

"English singsing Pets - Comparison Expression Oh, John! It’s great to see you here! Hi, Olivia! Is that your adorable dog? Yep. Her name is Sophie. She’s so cute. What type? Poodle. Do you want to hold her? No! I’m good. I just like to watch her. Haha. Are you scared of dogs? Sophie will never bite you. OHHHH. No, thanks. Alright~ What’s happening? Wow, what an adorable kitty! It’s lovely! Do you like cats too? Of course! I’m an animal lover. But I like dogs more than cats. Cats are clean and lovely, but they are too independent. So I prefer dogs, which are much friendlier. What about you? I agree. Animals are lovely. Both dogs and cats. But for me there’s something else, I’m afraid. What? What do you mean? Actually, I’m allergic to animals. ACHOO! Oh, I’m so sorry! I understand now! That’s why I like plants more than animals. Plants? Like what? One of my favorite plants is the one that eats bugs! An insect-eating plant! An insect eating plant opens its mouth and when a fly goes in, it closes its mouth. No way, John. You’re lying, aren’t you? I’ve never heard of it.

"English Singsing At the Art Museum Wow! I’ve never seen such a huge art museum! Tom, it’s not proper etiquette to speak that loudly. Alright… Olivia, which art pieces are you looking at now? It’s the ‘Mona Lisa’ by Leonardo da Vinci! I’ve always wanted to see this. This is the famous eyebrow-less Mona Lisa! I cannot take my eyes off her eyes. I want to take a picture with her! No, Tom! We can’t take pictures in this museum. Oh, I didn’t know that. I really wanted to take a photo with her. Hmm… This painting is a little bit freaky. Its nose and eyes are twisted and the colors are so unrealistic. That’s what makes an abstract painting so attractive. A painter expresses his own unrealistic expressions. This was painted by the most famous painter, Picasso. his painting seems like the painter loves the stars and the moon a lot. This art piece was drawn with repetitive brush touches and fancy color tones. That’s right. This is Vincent Van Gogh’s famous piece, ‘The Starry Night.’ What, Tom? Did you know about this painting? Nope. I just saw its title at the bottom here."

"English Singsing Understanding One’s Culture Say cheese! Cheese! Why are you holding up your fingers like that? Huh Don’t know this gesture? It represents V for victory. It’s a usual gesture when taking pictures! Oh, I think I’ve heard of it. But it has a different meaning in India. Like a scissors in rock, paper, scissors? Haha, that, too. What’s the other definition? Students in India use it in the classroom as a symbol. What does it mean? It means, ‘I want to go take a dump right now.' Haha, sounds cute. I really like this victory sign, but I will try to not use it in the classroom. What if you need to pee? Oh, if you need to pee, you just have to stick up your little finger. Wow, that’s interesting! It’s usually a gesture for making a promise. It’s really fun to learn about different cultures! Anyways, I was really confused by a gesture of showing your palm. How come? That just means, ‘Stop there,’ or ‘Reject’. You’re right. But in Africa, it’s a gesture of insulting someone. I can’t even tell you what it means. I see… I never knew that. I think I should be careful and try to understand other people’s culture. Yeah, you’re absolutely right."

It’s not even winter yet. And the weather is warm too! John, listen. It’s warm in the afternoon but what about in the morning? Isn't it cold? It’s easy to catch a cold during the change of the seasons. I didn’t know that. I thought people only caught colds during the winter. You should drink lots of warm water and eat to get vitamins. If you don’t get better in a few days, you need to go to a hospital. Yeah, I should… When is the science homework due? Ouch! What’s wrong? It hurts so much. I‘m scared that this might be a serious injury. Where? Did you get hurt? Look at this. John, I have a band aid. Don’t be a crybaby. Achoo! Oops. What’s wrong with you? Oh, no.

"English singsing Fun Science Fly away, balloon! Haha, John. The balloon won’t fly away like that. Huh? The balloons flew away with a house in the cartoon. Those balloons were probably filled up with helium gas. You are exhaling carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is heavier than oxygen, so your balloon will not fly. Oh! So, is helium lighter than oxygen? That’s right! Oh, I see. I thought balloons would always fly in the sky! Oh! I’m completely soaked! Roy, does it rain on the moon? The moon does not have air or water, so it never rains. Aha! And everything in space floats. So will my balloon be floating in space too? Well, your balloon contains air that you blew in, and the moon is in a vacuum state. What do you think will happen? Well? Will it shrink? No, think more. Hm… BOOM? That’s right! BOOM! There is a difference in pressure between outside and inside of the balloon, so the balloon gets bigger to equalize the pressure outside. Later, it will explode! Oh, my goodness! My balloon! People wear spacesuits for this reason. Astronauts wear spacesuits to protect their bodies! Oh, I didn’t know that. I thought astronauts in spacesuits were just trying to look nice. Wow! Science is always mysterious! It’s so fun! John, didn’t you say you want to be an astronaut? That’s right!

"People drink more than 1.6 billion cups of coffee every day all around the world That's enough to fill up three big football stadiums and still have more coffee left! but where did this amazing drink come from a long time ago around the 11th century There was a Muslim man from a Ethiopia His name was called was Khaldi He used to take care of the goats One day he saw that the goats were acting crazy they kept on running around with a lot of energy Khaldi found out that the goat started getting excited when they ate a certain berry The berry was bright red These berries were coffee berries, which are also known as coffee cherries Khaldi decided to taste the coffee berries He ate the berries and he got all excited and noticed that he had a lot more energy just like the goats and That is how coffee was discovered Now you might be confused since we make our coffee from brown coffee beans Now where do those brown coffee beans come from? Well inside the red coffee cherries, there is a whitish colored seed we take out the seed from the cherry and then we roast it and That is how to get our brown coffee beans After Khaldi discovered coffee this yummy drink quickly spread through the Arabian Peninsula with the first farms in Yemen Oh and fun fact since this drink was first an Arab drink coffee was actually called Qahwa when coffee spread to the Ottoman Empire which is now modern-day Turkey, Syria, Egypt, and some other countries the name qahwa turned into qahva When the coffee reached to Europe the name changed again from qahva to qava, to cafa all the way until the name changed to cafe and coffee So as you can see Coffee came from Muslims and was at first a Muslim drink For a long time Christians weren't even allowed to drink coffee They thought that coffee was Saytan's or the devil's drink because Muslims are drinking it Too the Christian world coffee was a bitter drink of Shaitaan Around 400 years later in the 15th century. Pope Clement the 8th Decided to taste a cup of coffee. He took a sip and he loved it. He Told his people that the drink was so delicious and that it was not right that Christians could not drink it Then he baptized or purified the coffee for the Christian world This meant that all Christians could now drink coffee as well Coffee is one of the greatest inventions that was invented by a Muslim which made a difference in this world Brother Khaldi was a true great Muslim hero whose invention made a great difference in this world May Allah (SWT) reward brother Khaldi for his great invention and give him the highest place in Jannah Ameen and next time when you drink a cup of coffee Be proud that our Muslim brother is the reason why we have this amazing drink. Oh And please let us know how you feel about our Muslim hero series If you have any other ideas Please let us know and have you ever wanted to make a big difference to help All over the world, we provide everything we can for free and are committed to keeping it that way For millions of Muslims and non-muslims all over the world One hundred percent of our operations are crowd funded from our generous audience We want to continue our dawah mission and we can do so with your help All donations are tax-deductible And sadaqa jariya which continues to benefit you when you pass away from this world May Allah (SWT) accept your generosity And may Allah give you the highest reward to you and your family in this world and the Hereafter"
"If you ask most people where they think the first university was built, , most people will think it was somewhere in Europe. If you ask them if a boy or a girl came up with the idea of a university, most will say that it was a boy. but did you know the first university was actually founded by a young Muslim woman in Fes, Morocco? Her name was Fatima al-Fihri. Fatima al-Fihri was born in 800 AD in Kairouan, Tunisia. Her father was a very rich businessman. When Fatima al-Fihri was a little girl her father wanted her, her sister, and her
brother to be well educated so they decided to move to Fez, Morocco since it
was one of the most influential Muslim cities at that time and had a great
education. Fatima al-Fihri grew up with a good education and got married to a rich
man. Everything in her life was perfect until one year her father, brother, and husband all died one by one. The three men left Fatima
al-Fihri and her sister with a lot of money. So instead of wasting their time crying,
Fatima al-Fihri and her sister decided to make their community better with their
money and make Allah (swt) happy In their town, Muslims were growing day by day. So Fatima al-Fihri’s sister built the Al-Andalus mosque while Fatima al-Fihri had something else in mind. She wanted to build a mosque but
she also wanted to build a center that would give higher education. This is how Fatima al-Fihri came up with the idea of the first University. She decided that
she would have a mosque and a university combined and she decided to name it
after her hometown and called it the Qarawiyyin Mosque and University. In the Ramadan of 859, the construction of the first university began. Being a Muslim woman didn’t stop Fatima al-Fihri to be active and communicate in a modest way
with the men that was working for this great project. Fatima al-Fihri was very pious and wanted to please Allah. She decided that she would fast every single
day until the whole building was completed. After two years of hard work
in 861 the first University was finally completed. Fatima al-Fihri prayed inside the Qarawiyyin mosque thanking Allah for helping her and asked Allah to bless the Qarawiyyin Mosque and University. The university and mosque was a success and many leaders donated more money over the years to make the university bigger. Qarawiyyin University welcomed people of all kinds and all religions. One of the
most famous students at that university was the Jewish philosopher named Maimonides. The Christian Pope Sylvester II also went there for higher education. Qarawiyyin University was like a bridge between Europe and the Muslim world. 
Fatima al-Fihri's the first university is proof that Islam treats woman in a good
way. The true Islam teaches us that boys and
girls are all equal and they should be treated that way as well. In a recent
2017 study it said that 130 million girls from all over the world could not
go to school simply because they were girls. Fatima al Fihri showed us that even a religious women can go to school and make a difference while still covering
up and being modest. Don't be ashamed that you're Muslim
be proud that you're Muslim and in Islam Allah (swt)'s first order to Muslim men and woman is to be educated because with true educated people we can make the world a better place and that is how we once had a great muslim golden
age and from that golden ages the Qarawiyyin University still continues to this day. Fatima al-Fihri came up with the idea of higher education and made the 1st University that changed our world
forever. Next time when you see a university
remember that it is because of our great Muslim sister, Fatima al Fihri. May Allah give her the highest place in Jannah. Ameen.

"Astronomy or the study of the universe
is pretty amazing because it helps us learn more about the universe that we
live in. There is so much to discover and we haven't figured out that much of the
universe yet but our Muslim brother Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi helped discover a lot and changed how we look at the stars forever. Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi was born in
903 AD in Iran and lived in the course of Emir Adud ad-Daula. Al Sufi was one of the nine famous Muslim astronomers of the past and is listed as one of the most
influential astronomers of the Middle Ages Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi dedicated his
life studying the stars and the universe the ancient Greeks of the past made
their predictions and discoveries but a lot of those discoveries and predictions
were wrong. Al Sufi corrected those wrong discoveries and predictions and wrote
them in his great book called The Book than a thousand stars and recorded their
positions. He's put all of those stars into 48 constellations or groups. Al Sufi
also listed the colors of those stars and estimated the brightness and the
size of each star. He also identified the Large Magellanic Cloud which is a galaxy
that can be seen from parts of Yemen, something the Europeans didn't figure
out until the 16th century.  Al Sufi also identified the Andromeda galaxy which is
also known as the small cloud. these galaxies were actually the first
galaxies to be observed from Earth besides the Milky Way galaxy which is
the galaxy that we live in. Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi discovered a lot more things
like calculating the length of the tropical year and some other things that
completely changed how we see our universe. A lot of the astronomical
works that came after him was discovered all because of our great Muslim brother
Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi may Allah give him the highest place in Jannah, Ameen. We

"The Day of Badr was on Friday, the 17th of
Ramadan during the 2nd Hijri. In this battle prophet Muhammad (s) was the
main leader or the commander in chief of the army. Abu Bakr, Hamza, Umar and Ali (pbut) were
the battlefield commanders. In the morning, Muhammad (s) setup the Muslims'
army in a very good way. When the enemies saw the Muslim soldiers all
setup, Allah (swt) put fear in their hearts, even though the Quraysh’s army was way bigger
than the Muslims. Because of the fear that Allah (swt) put in
the Quraysh’s heart, they became very scared to fight with the Muslims. But the bad Abu Jahl brainwashed all the Quraysh
to fight with the Muslims. Both battle groups positioned themselves face
to face. The prophet ordered the Muslims not to start
the fight at first. If the enemy started the fight, only then
would the Muslims start their fight. He also advised them to stay in their position. And when the enemies would come closer to
fight, they could use their arrows. When the enemies came extremely close, only
then they were allowed to use swords. But of course the battle started by an arrogant
bad Quraish. He wanted to take control of the Muslim's
water well all by himself. So he started to fight with Hamza (pbuh) and
finally died. It was the first death at the battle of Badr. Before the battle began, the bad Utbah took
his brother Shayba and his son Waleed to challenge against the Muslim. So from the Muslim army, 3 Anser came forward
to fight against them. Utbah started coming forward but then just
as he was about to fight, he realized that he didn’t recognize any of those Muslims
because they were the Muslims from Medina. So then he said that he want to fight with
the Muslims from Makkah. Then Muhammad (s) send Hamza, Ali and Ubaydah
(pbut) to fight with the enemies. Hamza (pbuh) easily destroyed Shayba, Ali
(pbuh) also easily destroyed Waleed. But Ubaydah (pbuh) and the bad Utbah were
still fighting against each other. Hamza and Ali (pbut) then came to help and
destroyed the evil Utbah. Ubaydah (pbuh) got hurt very badly and after
4/5 days later he died. Within few minutes (just after) when the Quraysh
lost their 3 best fighters, they became very upset and attached the Muslims with their
full strength. As planned before, the Muslims did not move
from their place. When the enemies came closer, the Muslims
started to strike their arrows and started to say loudly ""Ahad, Ahad"""" or One, One"" Immediately
all of the sudden, the enemies started to lose their life. And that made the enemies feel weak mentally. When the enemies were very close to the Muslims,
Prophet Muhammad (s) took a handful of dust and threw it onto the enemies and prayed to
Allah (swt) to destroy their face. He then ordered the Muslims to fight with
the enemies in the name of Allah (swt). The Muslims were mentally very strong and
focused, and with Allah (swt)’ blessings, it was very easy for them to destroy the enemies
one by one. It was a very horrible moment for the bad
Quraysh, because they had to fight with the Muslims along with a thousand of unseen Angels. Even though the prophet was the commander
in chief for the Muslims, there was a point where the prophet came out into the battle
field in order to encourage his people. At that point, Allah (swt) sent Surah Kamar,
verse 45 to give the good news of the Muslims’ victory. After they saw prophet Muhammad (s) in the
battlefield, the Muslims’s army got more excited and fought like the strongest army
in the world. When the Muslims fought the battle with the
stregnth of a lion, all the sudden the Quraish were very confused. Because Iblis wanted the bad people to win
the war, in that battle,Iblis also joined by taking the shape of Suraqa. However, when he saw the army of angels, he
ran away from the battle field into the Red sea. Animal: Did Iblis really come to fight with
the Muslims? Yusuf: Yes, in surah Anfal, verse 48, Allah
(swt) mentions that Iblis escaped from the battlefield. On the other hand, as the comander of chief
from the Qurayshs’ side, Abu Jahl was giving directions to his soldiers of the Quraysh
army. Abu Jahal, was very protected by many soldiers. No Muslim could come near him. At one point, two young Muslim boys came to
Abdur Rahman (pbuh), who was from Makkah, to show them who Abu Jahl was because they
both wanted to destroy the most evil man from Quraysh. Both of the young boys attacked Abu Jahl and
he fell out from his horse. Of the two boys, who went to attack Abu Jahal,
one of them, Mu'adh ibn Amr, was injured by Abu Jahl's son and lost one of his hand. Along with him the other young boy, Mu'adh
ibn Afra, died in that battlefield. Abu Jahl was badly injured and was lying on
the battleground. Abdullah bin Mas'ood finally destroyed that
evil guy, Abu Jahal, who was the greatest enemy of Islam. After Abu Jahl’s death, the Quraysh soldiers
became scared and tried to run away from the battlefield. Unlike any other battles, these soliders were
not fighting for land, money or honor, because they were fighting over the belief over the
one and only God.The Muslims had to fight against their fathers, uncles, brothers, cousins,
friends and even their own sons. Umar (pbuh) had to kill his maternal uncle
Aas and Abu Bakr had to fight with his own son. And even in that war, the Prophet's uncle
Abbas was captured as well. Fourteen brave Muslims died during the Battle. 6 were Muhajireen, the Muslims from Makkah
and 8 were Ansar, the Muslims from Madina. They were buried at Badr and that area is
still marked even to this day. On the other side, 70 bad Quraysh were killed
and 70 soldiers were arrested by the brave Muslims. Out of those people who died, most of them
were from different tribe's leaders and important people from the Quraysh. So because they were extremely bad people
who made the Muslims suffer, those dead Quraysh bodies were thrown into a bad smelling well. After the battle was over, the Prophet Muhammad
(s) stayed in Badr for three days to make sure that the Quraysh wouldn’t come attack
again. Before the prophet left Badr, he called all
the souls from the dead Quraysh leaders and told them that, how terrible their luck was
just because they did not accept the one and only true God Allah (swt). And he told them that Allah (swt) had kept
his promise and gave the victory to the Muslims."
"By the middle of the 8th Hijri year, Muslims controlled the Jews by winning the battle
of Khaibar and Bedouin with different sudden attacks and controlled the Quraysh with the
Hudaybia peace agreement. Now Allah (SWT) wanted the Muslims to control
Makkah permanently and take over the most holiest place, the Kabah. As you remember the Hudaybia peace agreement
had two sides. One side was Madina which were the Muslims,
and the other side was Makkah which were the Quraysh. And also any other tribes could join with
the Quraysh or Muslims and agree to also bring peace. Banu Khuzaa and Banu Bakr used to hate and
fight each other for a long time. They both agreed to the Hudaybia peace agreement. So Banu Khuzaa joined with the Muslims while
Banu Bakr joined with the Quraysh. The peace agreement made both of the sides
promise that they could not attack one another for ten years. After Banu Bakr joined with the Quraysh’s
group, they thought that it would be the best opportunity to take revenge and destroy the
Muslim’s friend the Banu Khuzaa tribe. In that situation, the Quraish of Makkah was
supposed to stop their friend the Banu Bakr tribe so they wouldn’t break their promise
that they made with the Hudaybia peace agreement. But unfortunately, the bad Quraysh started
to support the Banu Bakr Tribe's evil plan by giving their men and weapons. The very bad son of Umayyah, Amr and Abu Jahl's sons
joined the Banu Bakr tribe and attacked the Banu Khuzaa tribe at night and destroyed around
20 to 30 men. Some of the Banu Khuzaa men tried to escape
and took shelter at the house of Allah, the Kabah. Everybody knew it was the safest place on
the earth. No one was allowed to destroy anybody in that
area. But the evil Quraysh even broke that law and
destroyed some of the Banu Khuzaa men who took shelter in the Kabah. That evil attack broke and ruined the Hudaybia
Peace agreement. Some leaders from the Banu Khuzaa tribe came
to Prophet Muhammad (saw) and told him about the attack. The prophet promised to help them. By that time the Quraysh started to become
scared about doing their evil job and sent Abu Sufyan to renew the Peace agreement. At first, Abu Sufiyan went to his daughter
Ramla, known as Umm Habiba (r) who was one of the prophet's wives. She even did not let her father Abu Sufyan
even sit on her bed and completely ignored him. Then he went to the Prophet Muhammad (s) but
the prophet did not talk to him. Abu Sufyan then tried to talk to Abu Bakr,
Umar, and Ali (R). But everybody ignored the most powerful leader
in Arabia. When Abu Sufyan did not get any respect from
the Madina Muslims, he realized that his time was over. To make Abu Sufyan look foolish, Ali (r) told
him to go to the Prophet's Mosque and tell the people that he was keeping the peace agreement. But what he said made no sense since it was
up to Prophet Muhammad(s) to decide if he wanted to keep the peace agreement not him. Abu Sufiyan immediately left Madina and told
his people what had happened. They laughed at how Ali (r) made him a look
like a fool since what he said didn’t make any sense. As soon as Abu Sufyan left the Madina, the
Prophet ordered the Muslims to prepare for a battle against the Quraysh and start their
journey immediately. On Ramadan 11, 8 Hijri, Muslims started their
journey with a very big army. On the way, more Muslim soldiers were joined
from different places with the Prophet(saw). Finally, it became a very big army of ten
thousand soldiers. On the journey, the prophet met Abbas (r),
who was moving to Madina with his wife and children after becoming Muslims. The prophet took Abbas (r) with him and sent
his family to Madina for safety. Muslim soldiers were moving very fast. Coming from Medina to Makkah it took them
about a week, during the night time, they reached Marr-az-Zahran to set camp which was
only 8 miles away from Makkah and planned to attack Makkah the next morning. For safety, the prophet ordered to make ten
groups with one thousand people in each group. He told each group to set a different camp
and light their own campfire to show anyone that saw them that the Muslim army was very
big and strong. Umar (r) was in charge to manage all of that. The Makkans did not know the Muslims were
coming to attack them. When the people of Makkah suddenly heard about
the very big Muslim army that was waiting to attack them, they became very scared and
did not know what to do. Abu Sufyan came out to look at the Muslim
Army from a distance. He became very surprised to see, how the prophet
collected such a large army in such a short amount of time. The prophet told Abbas (r) was to go to Makkah
to warn the Quraysh so they could be prepared and get safety. On his way to Makkah, he saw and met Abu Sufyan. Abu Sufyan asked Abbas(r) on what he should
do to protect his people. Abbas (r) let Abu Sufyan ride his donkey and
brought him to the prophet. When Umar (r) saw Abu Sufyan, he wanted to
destroy him right away. But Abbas (r) stopped him and quickly took
Abu Sufyan to the prophet Muhammad (s)’ camp. Umar (r) came behind them and asked permission
from the prophet to destroy Abu Sufyan the most powerful leader and a disbeliever of
Makkah. Abbas (r) said he already gave protection
to Abu Sufyan. Umar (r) again asked permission from the prophet
to destroy Abu Sufyan. But finally, the prophet told Abbas (r) to
give Abu Sufyan shelter and keep Abu Sufiyan in his camp. In his heart, Abu Sufyan knew that Allah (SWT)
was always be one and only God and Muhammad (s) is the true prophet. The next morning when Abu Sufyan was brought
to the prophet he accepted Islam and became a Muslim. To show Abu Sufyan respect and honor the prophet
said, whoever entered the house of Allah would be safe, who entered the house of Abu Sufyan
would be safe, who shut their doors would be safe and whoever would be unarmed without
any weapons would be safe. Abu Sufyan became very happy. The prophet ordered Abbas (r) to take Abu
Sufyan to a hill to show the big Muslim army who were marching up and down the hills towards
Makkah with their heads held high. Different tribes were moving with their tribal
colors. He was thinking about how Allah (SWT) helped
the Muslims and made them so successful. He quickly went back to Makkah and told all
the people the good news that the Muslims would not harm anybody if they didn't fight. Hearing the good news everybody went to their
houses and closed the door. When the Prophet Muhammad (s) came close to
Makkah, he ordered Khalid bin Waleed (r) and his soldiers to enter the Makkah through the
lower side and wait for the prophet at Mount Safa. The prophet also ordered Zubayr (r) and his
soldiers to enter through the upper side of Makkah and wait at the Hajoon area. The Prophet ordered Abu Ubaydah (r) and his
soldiers to go through the valley and enter Makkah before the Prophet. One very small group of the bad Quraysh were
still waiting to fight with the Muslims. So the Muslims had to destroy around 12 bad
people so the rest escaped. The Prophet wanted to avoid all kind of fighting
and enter Makkah peacefully. Khalid and Zubayr (r) took control of Makkah
and waited at the Safa and Hajoon area. When the prophet reached there, he took some
rest and then moved forward with Abu Bakr (r). At last, on Ramadan 17, 8 Hijri, the moment
Muslims had been waiting for finally arrived. After almost 21 years of patience and hard
times, Allah (SWT)'s Messenger finally entered the holiest Mosque without any problem. At that time he lowered his head to give thanks
to Allah (SWT). Allah (SWT) made the entry very successful
with a victorious and glorious feeling of the Prophet. After Muhammad(saw) entered the Kabah, he
kissed the black stone and went around the Kabah seven times with his camel. At that time around the Kabah, there were
360 idols. The prophet broke each of the idols with a
stick by reading some Quranic verses. And by a miracle, every one of them was broken. After that, he took the keys of the Kabah
from Uthman bin Talha, then ordered to remove all the idols and pictures from inside. Finally, he entered the Kaaba with Usama and
Bilal (r) and prayed two Rakah to Allah (SWT). After the prayer, he explored the inside of
the kabbah while praising and glorifying Allah (SWT), the one and only god."
"Part 22
In order to warn the Quraysh to back off, the Muslims tried to show that they were not
weak anymore, and so the people of Makkah should stop messing with the innocent Muslims. During the second year of the Hijri, or the
2nd year of the Islamic calendar, in the 5th month (Jamad Al-Ula), Prophet Muhammad (s)
took more than 150 Muhajireen, who were Muslims from Makkah, and went to the west, next to
the Red Sea to the city of Ushayrah to fight back with one of the Quraysh's biggest business
group, who were going to Syria. Abu Sufyan was the leader of that business
group. Unfortunately, that business group left that
place a few days before Muhammad (s) reached there. But luckily, when returning back from that
journey Muhammad (s) made some friends with some new tribes. A month later, the Prophet originally sent
12 Muhajireen, but since 2 of them lost their camel, only 10 of them went to a town very
close to Makkah, which was the city of Nakhlah. That place was between Makkah and Ta'if. During that time it was the 7th month of the
Arabic calendar, which was the month of Rajab in the 2nd Hijri. Before Prophet Muhammad (saw) many centuries
ago, Allah (SWT) selected the month of Rajab for Umrah to visit the Kabbah for worship. During this month, for the safety of those
who wanted to visit the Kabbah, no fighting or war was allowed. The only reason why the Prophet sent those
Muslims to Makkah was so that they could get some information about the Quraysh and their
business travel plans, but unfortunately, when the Muslims saw a small Quraysh business
group, they attacked the Quraysh and killed one person. They also arrested two of the enemies and
brought them back to Madina with them. When Prophet Muhammad (s) heard about what
had happened, he became very upset. He immediately freed those arrested enemies
and paid a fee for their mistake to the family of the person who was killed accidently. After that event, the Quraysh used that opportunity
and spread scandals against the Muslims because they broke Allah's law by attacking the people
in the Holy month of Rajab. It was a very uncomfortable situation for
the Muslims. Allah (SWT) then sent Surah Baqara verse 217
about that situation and said that it was bad to fight in the month of Rajab. But then Allah (SWT) also said in that ayah,
that the Quraysh were killing many innocent Muslims and throwing them out of their own
houses which was even worse. After that, Allah (SWT) sent many Quranic
sentences to give as guidelines of how to deal with the evil people. If the evil people wanted to fight, Muslims
would also have to fight back with them. If they want to become friends, Muslims also
should accept their friendship. Around that time, about 2 weeks before Ramadan,
something very important happened in Islam. Before, the Muslims used to pray their prayer
towards the direction of the Al Aqsa mosque in Palestine. But from that day, Allah (SWT) changed the
law for the Muslims, and told them in Surah Baqara verse 144, to pray their prayers towards
the direction of the Kabbah in Makkah. Some Jewish people who claimed themselves
as Muslims did not like the new law from Allah (SWT). That’s because they were false Muslims,
and because Allah (swt) changed his laws, it helped the Muslims know who
fake Muslims were and who the real Muslims were. Animal: Why were the Jewish people who claimed
themselves as Muslims not happy with the new law? It’s because all of their prophets used
to pray in the direction of the Al-Aqsa mosque. Since they were used to praying in that direction
for many many years, they were not happy with the change. During the same month of Shaban, Allah (SWT)
gave another law in Islam that, every healthy Muslim would have to fast during the entire
month of Ramadan. Before that law, fasting was not mandatory
for Muslims. The Quraysh were very angry at the Muslims
for their bravery. They realized that their business route to
the north was not safe anymore because of the Muslims in Madina. So the evil Quraysh wanted to attack Madina
and kill all the Muslims to make their business route safe. It was a foolish decision for the Quraysh
to attack Madina, because they could’ve easily became friends with the Muslims, but
instead their arrogant wish was to kill all the Muslims in Madina. During the next month which was Ramadan, in
the 2nd Hijri or second Islamic year, in the year of 624, one of the most important events
happened in Islam. This was the famous Battle of Badr. Abu Sufyan's business group was returning
from Syria with lots of business items. It was a very big business trip for the people
of Makkah. Almost all of the rich leaders from Makkah
invested their money with Abu Sufyan in that business trip. Abu Sufyan was a very smart businessman. He was very careful to avoid the Muslims in
order to protect his business group. When Prophet Muhammad (s) got the news about
Abu Sufyan's business group,the prophet took around 313 Muslims with him to stop Abu Sufyan’s
business group, in order to give them a message to stop messing with the Muslims. Animal: So if the people of Makkah were the
superpower in the land of Arabia at that time, why did the Prophet only take 313 Muslims
to fight with the strong Quraysh? Yusuf: No, he did not want to fight with anyone. That's why he did not take all of the Muslims
with him. He wanted to bring peace between the Muslims
and Quraysh. His plan was to scare the Quraysh so the Quraysh
would stop killing the innocent Muslims and let the Muslims live in peace. Prophet Muhammad basically wanted to establish
Allah (swt)'s law, so that everyone would have their own right to follow their own religion
freely. No one should ever give a hard time to anybody
for their religious belief. That's why he had only 313 Muslims, two horses,
and only 70 camels for their journey. Because there weren’t that many camels,
they had to share the camels for their ride to the place of Badr, next to the Red Sea. It was around 90 miles south-west of Madina. In that Muslim group, there were only 82 Muhajireen,
which were the Makkah's Muslims and around 230 were the Ansar, who were Madina's Muslims. Animal: Why were the Muslims trying to go
to the place of Badr? Yusuf: Badr was surrounded by high mountains
with some water wells, and for travelers like them, it was the best place to take rest on
the way. The Prophet knew that Abu Sufyan's business
group would take rest in the place of Badr. Abu Sufyan had 40 people, 100 camels and lots
of expensive business items. When Abu Sufyan heard that, the Muslims made
a plan to attack his caravan, he became very scared and did not follow his usual route. He quickly changed the route and sent one
of his people to Makkah to get some soldiers to save his expensive business items. When the Quraysh heard the news, they became
very angry and got ready to protect Abu Sufyan and his business group. They quickly gathered 1,300 soldiers. Almost all the leaders from Makkah joined
that group. The only leader who didn’t join the group
was Abu Lahab, and since he didn’t go, he sent one of his men instead to fight in his
place against the Muslims. All of the tribes joined the army except for
one family group from the Quraysh, the Banu Adiy. Abu Jahl was one of the main leaders of the
Quraysh during the battle and he was very excited about that mission, since he didn’t
like the Muslims. When the bad Qurayish reached the middle of
their journey, at the place of Rabigh or Juhfa, the Quraish got the message from Abu Sufyan
that his business group was saved and the army should return back to Makkah. However, Abu Jahl did not like the idea of
returning to Makkah because he wanted to destroy the Muslims. So he was able to convince almost all the
people to fight with the weak Muslims. Originally, the Banu Zahra family group went
to fight in order to protect the business group, but later on they did not agree with
Abu Jahl so they backed down because they didn’t want to destroy the Muslims for no
reason. So because of that almost 300 soldiers from
Banu Zahra returned to Makkah. Then Abu Jahl continued his journey with remaining
1000 soldiers to fight against the Muslims. Finally, they set up their camp behind the
Mountain of Badr area. When Prophet Muhammad (s) heard that the Quraysh
were coming to destroy the Muslims, he immediately set up a meeting with the Muslims soldiers
and their leaders. At first, some of them were scared to fight
with the strong Quraysh soldiers. But when they heard Abu Bakr, Umar and Miqdad
(pbut)'s opinion everyone became mentally strong to fight with their strong enemies. These three strong Muslim leaders were the
Muhajirin, who were from Makkah. However two third of the entire group of men
were the Ansar, those who were from Madina. So Prophet Muhammad (s) wanted to know, what
the Ansars were thinking. Then one of the Ansar's leaders Sa'd (PBUH)
said he strongly supported the Prophet's decision. With Allah (swt)'s blessing, everyone else
agreed to fight with the bad Quraysh. For more detailed information about this event
we can find information at the beginning of Surah Anfal. This fight was very important for the Muslims. If the Muslims were scared to fight with the
bad Qurayish, Islam would’ve been very weak, which meant that the Quraysh would go to Madina
to kill all the Muslims and no one would have any faith in the power of Islam. Muhammad (s) started his journey with those
brave Muslims to the place of Badr and arrived there the same night as the Quraysh. The Muslims set up their camp at Badr. Compared to the Quraish, the Muslim army was
very small. So because of that it was important for the
Muslims to come up with a smart strategy that would help them win. But one expert solder Hubab (PBUH) requested
Prophet Muhammad (s) to move forward the camp, so they could control the majority of the
water wells. He also requested to fill up all the water
wells using stones and to kept one water well for themselves, so the enemy could not get
any water. Hearing this, Prophet Muhammad (s) accepted
Hubab's (PBUH) brilliant advice, because they needed all the strategies that they could
possibly do especially since the Muslims weren’t even ready to go to battle. He also sent 3 brave Muslims, Ali, Zubaer
and Sa'd (pbut) to get some information about their enemies. Those brave Muslims went very close to the
enemy’s camp, and found two slaves were carrying some water. So they immediately arrested them and brought
them to the prophet. From those slaves Muhammad (s) got some important
information about their enemies, like how many soldiers they had and who were in that
battle group. The Muslims also made a small tent for Muhammad
(s) from where he could give direction to his in the battlefield. When all of the preparations were completed,
Muhammad (s) started to pray for the Muslims’ victory and blessing from Allah (s). Allah (s) accepted Prophet’s request and
promised that at the battlefield one thousand angels would come to help the Muslims gain
their victory. Animal: Did Allah (SWT) really send one thousand
angels to help the Muslims? Yusuf: Yes, you can find this information
in Surah Anfal, verse 9. But how they helped the Muslims we don't know. There are different opinions from the scholars,
but only Allah (SWT) knows the best. During the night Allah (SWT) gave them a blessing
rain in order to purify the Muslims and to give them mental strength.Then Allah (swt)
miraciously made everyone fall asleep so that they would be refreshed in the morning and
would have full energy to fight with the enemies."

"91 Surah Ash-Shams (The Sun) After five years of Muhammad's (s) prophethood,
the bad people started to give a very hard time to those who accepted Islam. In some cases, the bad Qurayish tried to destroy
the Muslim's lives. When their torture became extreme, to warn
the bad people Allah (swt) sent Surah Ash-Shams. In this surah, Allah (swt) brings an example
of another group, the bad people of Thamud, who also did not listen to their prophet,
Prophet Saleh (as)'s advice. Allah also mentioned what he did to them as
a punishment. (1-6) Allah (swt) started this surah with
an oath about the sun and its bright light. The word 'Shams' usually refers to the time
between sunrise and midday when the sun is up. Then Allah (swt) talks about the moon and
its movement and how it follows the sun. Then he mentions that during the daytime we
see the sunlight. But the nighttime hides the sun from us. Allah (swt) talks about the sky and how he
created it and the earth which he spread out for us. (7-8) Allah (swt) made our soul perfectly. He made our body with hands, feet, brain,
and height. We have senses like sight, hearing, touch,
taste, and smell so we can learn about the world too. We also have thinking abilities like reasoning,
imagination, memory, and judgment, which help us to live as humans. Allah (swt) made every child with a good soul. But when we get older it becomes our choice
to be good or bad. Allah (swt) gave us the ability to know what
are good and bad actions. God gifted us knowledge to help us live, think,
and understand to do right actions. (9-10) So far Allah (swt) talked about some
pairs and their differences like the sun and the moon, day and night, sky and earth. All of them are different in their nature
and actions. In the same way, humans can be good or evil. It is our choice to do any action. Allah (swt) does not force us to do something. We are responsible for our own actions. Those who try to do good and purify themself,
become successful in this life and the hereafter. But those who don't control themselves and
do whatever they want to do and start to do bad jobs, are failures in this world and hereafter. (11) Basically Allah (swt) gives a special
guidebook inside of everyone. This guidebook helps us to know the difference
between good things like sharing and being kind and bad things like being mean or selfish. This guidebook helps us to make good choices
and be happy forever. But if we ignore it and do bad things we will
be in big trouble. As an example, Allah (swt) talks about the
people of Thamud. They had the same guidebook in their heart. But they chose not to follow it. They didn't listen to their prophet Salih
(as) and kept doing bad things. Because they refused to follow the guidebook
and chose the wrong path, Allah punished them. For the details of the story, watch our video
on Prophet Saleh (as). (12-13)
Prophet Salih (as) was sent by Allah to guide the people of Thamud. But the people were very bad and stubborn. They asked for a miracle to prove that he
was a true prophet. As a miracle Allah (swt) sent a very big and
attractive pregnant camel from a rock. The camel started to live with those people. Within a short time, she gave birth to a calf. Some people believed in Allah (swt) after
seeing this miracle but most of them didn't like it. They started to hate the camel. The camel was so big that it drank all of
the water from their well and gave lots of milk to the people. So prophet Saleh (as) set a rule, one day
the camel would drink water, and the next day the people and their animals could drink
the water from the well. But some Thamud people didn't like this rule. They asked their evil leader to destroy the
camel. Prophet Saleh (as) warned them Allah (swt)'s
punishment would come if they destroyed the camel. But the evil people didn't listen prophet's
advice, and they destroyed the camel. As punishment, on the first day, Allah (swt)
made their faces turn yellow, on the second day, red, and on the third day, black. And then without hesitation, a loud sound
wave destroyed them all instantly. (15) Allah (swt) is the most powerful and
has control over everything. No one can save us from Allah (swt)'s punishment. So we should not be arrogant like the people
of Thamud and follow Allah's law and order. Lastly, we should be grateful to Allah (swt)
for his mercy and guidance. Important Facts About Ash-Shams
1. The name of surah Ash-Shams came from the
first word of the Surah. 2. Allah (swt) sent this Surah to Makkah when
the bad people started to punish the new Muslims. 3. Surah Ash-Shams means ""the Sun"". 4. This Surah has 15 short sentences. 5. This Surah mentions the people of Prophet
Saleh (as) also known as the Thamud. 6. Surah Ash-Shams is the 91st number Surah/chapter
in  the Quran."
The People of the Garden Story from Surah Qalam
"93. Surah Ad-Duha (Morning Light) At the beginning of prophethood, being a&nbsp;
prophet was a very hard job for Muhammad&nbsp;&nbsp; (s). At that point, Allah (swt) revealed only&nbsp;
a little bit of the Quran. Since Muhammad (s)&nbsp;&nbsp; was the prophet of our ummah, he had to make&nbsp;
himself a living Quran so the people would&nbsp;&nbsp; understand how to follow Allah (swt)’s orders&nbsp;
correctly. So when someone would see him,&nbsp;&nbsp; right away they would understand the&nbsp;
meaning of the Quran. But at the beginning,&nbsp;&nbsp; this was very difficult for Muhammad (s),&nbsp;
both physically and mentally. Allah (swt)&nbsp;&nbsp; knew this was a lot for him especially at&nbsp;
the beginning, so to give him some rest,&nbsp;&nbsp; Allah (swt) for a little bit, stopped sending the&nbsp;
Quranic chapters. At first Muhammad (s) thought,&nbsp;&nbsp; that Allah (swt) was angry at him and left him&nbsp;
all alone in his Dawah work. But that’s not true.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even all the bad people started to laugh at him&nbsp;
and insulted him as a false prophet. All of this&nbsp;&nbsp; made prophet Muhammad (s) very sad and hopeless.&nbsp;
But to encourage him and make him mentally strong,&nbsp;&nbsp; almost one month later Allah (swt) sent&nbsp;
Surah Duha by mentioning day and night. (1-3) After a busy day we might become very&nbsp;
tired. So, Allah (swt) turns the daytime into&nbsp;&nbsp; nighttime for our peace and rest so that we can&nbsp;
be ready and refreshed for the next busy day.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning of the prophethood, Muhammad (s)&nbsp;
felt extra pressure physically and mentally. When&nbsp;&nbsp; Jibrail (a) used to give him some sentences of the&nbsp;
Quran to Muhammad (s), he felt extreme physical&nbsp;&nbsp; pressure and would start to sweat. It was so&nbsp;
stressful for him that he could not even move his&nbsp;&nbsp; own hand. If Muhammad (s) was on top of a camel,&nbsp;
right away the camel would sit down because of the&nbsp;&nbsp; extreme pressure. He also faced social pressure&nbsp;
to bring back the true religion. Lots of bad&nbsp;&nbsp; people started to give him a hard time and spread&nbsp;
lies and bad information about him. Basically,&nbsp;&nbsp; as soon as Islam came, it completely changed&nbsp;
his way of life. So when Allah (swt) paused&nbsp;&nbsp; the revelation of the Quran, prophet Muhammad (s),&nbsp;
was able to get some rest, and he was able to calm&nbsp;&nbsp; down and become relaxed and didn’t have to worry&nbsp;
about trying to be the role model for the new&nbsp;&nbsp; verses so quickly. Allah (swt) did this because He&nbsp;
loved the prophet so much from the very beginning. (4-5) Allah (swt) gave Muhammad (s) a&nbsp;
promise during a very difficult time&nbsp;&nbsp; when only a few Muslims were with him. Allah&nbsp;
(swt) said day by day his situation will be&nbsp;&nbsp; better and better. His power, glory, and&nbsp;
honor will all increase. He told him that&nbsp;&nbsp; he would be very successful in this world.&nbsp;
Allah (swt) also told him that he would give&nbsp;&nbsp; him the very highest reward and respect in the&nbsp;
Hereafter. Allah (swt) promised that by the end,&nbsp;&nbsp; Muhammad (s) would be very happy when he saw&nbsp;
how his hard work would successfully change the&nbsp;&nbsp; world forever. People will happily change and&nbsp;
come to the true religion and do good actions. (6) Allah (swt) love the prophet very much from&nbsp;
his childhood. He supported Muhammad (s) when he&nbsp;&nbsp; was born as an orphan. His mother took care of&nbsp;
him until the age of six. After his mother died&nbsp;&nbsp; his grandfather took care of him until the age of&nbsp;
eight. When his grandfather died, his uncle Abu&nbsp;&nbsp; Talib gave him great love. Even when he became a&nbsp;
Prophet, and the entire nation became his enemy,&nbsp;&nbsp; his uncle Abu Talib continued to support&nbsp;
him for years so that he could spread Islam. (7) Even before Muhammad (s) became&nbsp;
a Prophet, he did not know where to&nbsp;&nbsp; find the true faith. He was looking for&nbsp;
the right guidance to change his very bad&nbsp;&nbsp; and injustice society. Then the merciful Allah&nbsp;
(swt) gave him Islam to guide humankind forever. (8) Allah (swt) also solved his financial&nbsp;
problems. Basically, he was very poor in&nbsp;&nbsp; his childhood. His father left him only a&nbsp;
camel and a servant. When he became young,&nbsp;&nbsp; Allah (swt) gave him a very rich business&nbsp;
partner Khadija (r). Then with his own hard&nbsp;&nbsp; work and ability, Allah (swt) made him a&nbsp;
rich independent businessman in Makkah. (9-11) When Muhammad (s) was an orphan&nbsp;
and poor, Allah (swt) helped him. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; Allah (swt) tells him that he should be grateful&nbsp;
for all the blessings that he got from Allah&nbsp;&nbsp; (swt). And to show that he was really thankful,&nbsp;
Allah (swt) advised him to give back kindness&nbsp;&nbsp; by helping other orphans and the poor and needy&nbsp;
people in a very polite and kind way. Finally,&nbsp;&nbsp; Allah advised that He should also&nbsp;
spread the message of Islam and&nbsp;&nbsp; teach the lessons of the Quran to all kinds&nbsp;
of people to show Allah (swt) blessings. Important Facts of Ad-Duha
The name of this surah came&nbsp;&nbsp; from the first word of the Surah.
Allah (swt) sent this Surah in Makkah&nbsp;&nbsp; during the beginning of prophethood.
Allah (swt) sent this&nbsp;&nbsp; surah, Ad-Duha, right before Surah Al-Inshirah.
Surah Ad-Duha means the morning bright light.&nbsp; This Surah has only 11 short sentences.
To be a good Muslim, we must take&nbsp;&nbsp; care of orphans and the needy.
We can be happy by helping others.&nbsp; To get the highest reward,&nbsp;
we should treat people well.&nbsp; We should always remember Allah&nbsp;
(swt)’s blessing in our lives."
"Prophet Musa and Khidr: A Journey of Wisdom
and Patience Once upon a time, there was a great prophet
named Musa or Moses (pbuh). One-day prophet Musa (as) was teaching Allah
(swt) laws to his people. One of the Bani Israel asked him, Is Musa
(as) was the most knowledgeable person on Earth? Musa (as) thought he was. Then Allah (swt) informed him, no man could
have all of the knowledge in the world. One man, named Khidr (as) had some knowledge
that he did not has. Musa (as) was interested to meet with him. So the next day, he started his journey with
a young boy, named prophet Yusha (pbuh). Allah (swt) told him to take a fish with him
and wherever he would lose the fish that was the place, he would find Khidr (pbuh). After traveling for a long time, they reached
a place where two rivers met and decided to rest there. Instantly, Musa (pbuh) fell asleep. The young Prophet Yusha (pbuh) saw the fish
skip into the river and swim away. He waited for Musa (pbuh) to wake up to inform
him about the fish, but when he awoke, Yusha (pbuh) forgot to tell him. So they continued their journey for long time. When they became hungry, Musa (pbuh) asked
for the fish. Yusha (pbuh) immediately informed him about
how the fish jumped into the river. So they went back to that place and found
Khidr (pbuh) lying there, covered with a garment. When Musa met Khidr, he politely asked if
he could join him and learn from his wisdom. Khidr agreed but said that Musa (pbuh) had
to be patient and not question what he did until he explained why he did it. Musa (pbuh) said that he’d keep his patience
and not disturb him. So both of them started to walk along the
shore and got into a boat. They saw a bird drinking water from the sea. Khidr (pbuh) compared Allah (swt)'s knowledge
as the seawater and our knowledge is as little as the bird drinking water from the sea. Suddenly he made a hole in their boat. Prophet Musa (pbuh) could not keep his patience
and got angry with Khidr (pbuh) and asked if he was trying to drown the people. Khidr reminded him to be patient and Musa
(pbuh) became sorry. They started to walk and saw a boy playing. Suddenly, Khidr (pbuh) held the boy and killed
him. Seeing that horrible thing, Musa (pbuh) again
lost his patience and got angry at Khidr (pbuh) for his action. Khidr again reminded him that he said that
he’d be patient and Musa (pbuh) became sorry. He also requested Khidr (pbuh) to give him
a last chance. They again started their walk to a village
and asked for some food from the villagers, but they refused. They were very bad people. Then they saw an old wall, which looked like
it was going to break. So he started to fix that wall for free. Prophet Musa (pbuh) again lost his patience
and asked why he was doing free work for bad people, who even did not even give them any
food. Khidr (pbuh) told Musa that that was the end
of their journey together since he could not be patient. He then explained why he did all the things
that he did that confused Musa(pbuh). First, he explained that he made a hole in
the boat because there was an evil king who would collect all the good boats. So, by making a small hole, he saved the boat
so the poor owners could keep it. Second, Khidr took the life of a young boy
based on Allah's guidance because Allah knew that the boy would grow up to be very bad
and ungrateful to his parents. So Allah decided to replace him and give the
good righteous parents a good child who would grow up and help society. Lastly, he fixed the wall for free because
the owners of the wall were two kids. They did not have a father and mother but
they were very good religious people. Under that wall, their parents hid some treasures
for them. And if that wall broke, they would not be
able to stop the bad people from taking away their treasures. So Allah (swt) decided to protect their treasures
until they grew up. Musa(pbuh) was surprised and understood that
everything that Khidr(pbuh) did was guided by Allah's wisdom and knowledge. This story from the Holy Quran, Surah Kahf
verses 65-82, helps us realize the importance of trusting in Allah's plan, even if we do
not fully understand why certain things happen. Allah is the best of planners and does everything
for a reason. This story also reminds us to be patient and
trust Allah's perfect plan."
"Surah Fil Abdullah got married to Amina, one the most
honorable women in Quraysh. Amina became pregnant after a few days. During that time, Abdullah went to Syria for
a business trip. However about two months before Mohammed (pbuh)
would be born, his father died at Madinah, on his return journey. At that time he was only 25 years old. Abdullah could not see his son Mohammed (pbuh). But he knew his wife was pregnant. During that time, Makkah was very famous for
house of God and it became a very big business center. Governor of Yemen, Abraha became very greedy
to take control of Makkah. At one excuse, he was ready to attacked Makkah
with a very big army. With him, he had sixty thousand solders and
around 13 big elephants. Abraha used the biggest elephant for himself. The people of Makkah became scared. Abdul Muttalib had a very strong faith in
Allah (swt). He knew the house of Allah would be saved
in a miracle way because they did not had enough strength to fight Abraha’s Army. He told everyone to take all of their family
members and hide at the mountain tops. At that time Muhammad (s) mother was seven
months pregnant. Then the miracle started to happen. When Abraha’s army was close to Makkah,
all the elephants just sat right there. Nothing could move them. Suddenly, all the elephant started to run
in the other direction. Meanwhile, Allah (swt) sent lots of small
birds with three stones. One was in their beak and the other two were
in their claws. The birds dropped their stones on Abraha’s
men. The stones cut their body parts right away
and killed them instantly. Their body became like mashed corn. It was a horrible moment for Abraha’s Army. Every one of them died by Allah (swt) punishment. At that time, Rome and Persian empires were
very powerful. That miracle was the big alarm to the whole
world. To warn them not to attack Makkah. It was a big welcome sign for prophet Muhammad
(s) coming to protect Allah (swt)’s house and law. Around fifty days later our beloved prophet
Muhammad (s) was born. After his prophet hood Allah (swt) send the
Surah Fil. In this Surah Allah (swt) remind the people
how he destroyed Abraha's army by just little bids. Surahs Fun Facts:
1. The meaning of Fil is ""the Elephant""
2. At his young life Abraha was a slave
3. Abraha built a very big temple and announced
the Arab people not to go to Kabba for worship and instead go to his temple
4. Abraha attacked the Kabba just 50 days before
Muhammad (s) was born. 5. Before Abraha attacked, Abdul Muttalib forgot
all of the 360 idols and prayed to only Allah (swt) to save the house of the Kabah.
6. After this incident, the next 7 to 10 years,
the people of Quraish always remembered Allah (swt) as their God."
"90. Surah Al Balad (The City)
(1-3) At the beginning of Muhammad (s)'s prophethood, when the bad people started to give a very
hard time to the Muslims as a warning Allah (swt) sent the Surah Balad. In some cases, the bad Qurayish started to
torture and destroy Muslim lives in Makkah, which was the safest city in all of Arabia. That’s why Allah (swt) started surah Balad
swear by the special city, Makkah. People knew why it was so special. Long ago, Prophet Ibrahim (as) came here with
his family. It was a lonely place, with only mountains
and dry land. But he built a prayer house and invited people
to visit it. Makkah later became a big city, important
for trade and religion. It was so safe that it became the only secure
place in the whole of Arabia for many generations. (4) Life isn't always easy. People are made to face challenges and work
hard. Even a powerful king or ruler has worries
and problems. A special person like Muhammad (s) also had
to face lots of difficulties to spread Islam. Nobody can escape from facing troubles in
life. Our life is tough from the moment we are born
until we grow up. When we are babies, we cannot take care of
ourselves. We rely on others to take care of us. (5) But when people grow up, they start to
think they can do whatever they want and forget the creator Allah (swt)’s blessing. As an example, Allah (swt) made Pharaoh a
very powerful king in Egypt. To even get more power he started to break
Allah (swt)’s laws and orders and give a hard time to the Bani Israel. At one point he even claimed himself as God
and tried to kill Prophet Musa (as) and his followers, the Bani Israel. But when Allah (swt) attacked him in the Red
Sea, he could not save himself from that water. So, it's important for us to remember that
Allah(swt) has complete power in everything. (6) But whoever forgets that, they become
arrogant. They don't care to use their money for good
reasons, like helping others. They spend it to show off how rich and important
they are. (7) They don't realize that there's a higher
power Allah (swt), who sees everything. Allah knows how they got their wealth, how
they spent it, and what their intentions were. No one can impress Allah (swt) by showing
off and bragging. Allah (swt) doesn’t like this kind of behavior. (8-9) Do you how we can learn? We're given special tools like eyes, tongue,
and lips by Allah (swt). But it's not just about seeing or talking. Our eyes help us see things around us, and
if we use them wisely, we can understand what's right and wrong. And our tongue and lips aren't just for speaking,
they're connected to our smart brains that help us think, understand, and express ourselves. (10) After giving us the ability to think
and reason, we're not left all alone. Allah (swt) gave us guidance, the Quran. It shows us two different roads. One is a good destination and the other is
a bad destination. The good road can be kind of difficult but
the bad road is very easy. (11) As an example, Imagine there are two
paths in front of us. One is like climbing a high mountain - it's
tough and needs a lot of effort. The other path is like going downhill - it's
easy and doesn't need much work. Now, which path takes us to a beautiful place? The first one, which is harder. (12-18) Do you know why the path to a successful
life is hard? Because in this path we need to free slaves
or help others. In the modern day, we need to help unfortunate
helpless people who need help, like refugees, servants, and underage or low-paid workers,
bringing justice to the labor force. We need to give food to hungry people and
help orphan children in every single way. Overall we have to help all kinds of needy
people. But it is not always very easy to help people. If any kind of trouble comes we have to be
patient and believe that Allah (swt) is always with us. He will save us and remove all kinds of problems. For example: One day a poor orphan boy came
to bad Abu Jahl to get all of his land and money which his father left for the orphan
boy. That orphan boy did not have any clothes to
wear. But bad Abu Jahl refused to give him the money
that belonged to him. The poor boy did not know what to do. Some of Abu Jahl's friends laughed at the
orphan boy. They even told him to go to Muhammad (s) with
his complaint. At that time Abu Jahl and his friends were
giving a very hard time to Muhammad (s) and all of the Muslims. Muslims were very weak at that time. They thought Muhammad (s) could not help that
orphan. That poor boy went to Muhammad (s) and complained
about Abu Jahl. The prophet stood up for him right way and
took the boy to Abu Jahl. He told Abu Jahl to return the orphan’s
money right away. Abu Jahl became afraid and returned the orphan
money right away. Abu Jahl’s friends were surprised to see
that. Later Abu Jahl told them, he saw two spears
with Muhammad (s). One was on his right side and the other was
on his left side. If Abu Jahl refused to give that orphan his
money, those spears would kill him. Basically, we should not be afraid to do good
things because Allah (swt) is our one and only protector. By helping orphans and others we can confirm
our place in Heaven. (19-20) But those who don’t do this kind
of helpful things, basically they don’t follow Allah (swt)’s advice. And they are very bad people. Allah (swt) will send them to the Hellfire. No one can’t save them from that terrible
Hellfire, except Allah (swt)’s mercy and kindness. May Allah (swt) help us to follow his guidance,
the Quran completely, Ameen. Important Facts of Al Balad:
1. The name of Surah Al-Balad came from the first
sentence of the Surah. 2. Allah (swt) sent this Surah in Makkah when
the bad people started to punish the new Muslims. 3. Surah Al-Balad means ""the City"". 4. This Surah has only 20 short sentences. 5. Surah Al-Balad is the 90th chapter in the

"Surah Kauthar At the age of 25, Mohammad (s) married Khadija
(r). Before Muhammad (s) became prophet he had
all his 6 children. His first child is son Qasim, then daughter
Zainab, son Abdullah, daughter Kulthum, Fatima and Ruqayyah (pbut) all. His older son died before his prophet hood. At that time daughter did not had any value. So if someone did not had son, basically he
did not had any future to carry his legacy. So when Muhammad (s) became prophet, he had
4 daughters and only son Abdullah. As you know after his prophet hood most of
the people did not believe him. They even did not accept Allah (swt) as their
only God. So they started to give him very hard time,
physically and mentally. Because he did not follow his family religion,
everybody thought his future was dark. He was rejected by his family and community. At that time, his only son, Abdullah died. So he had only 4 daughter left. Most of the non believers were very happy
to hear the news. Everybody thought his future was finished. There was no one to carry his family name
and legacy. Muhammad (s) became very sad and heartbroken. At that time Allah (swt) send surah Kauther
to give him very good news of giving a most beautiful fall and river hereafter. Also it's mention that his enemy would be
destroyed. At the Day of Judgment when everybody was
thirsty, Muhammad (s) would take all Muslim to the Kauthar river. The water would be whiter then the milk and
Sweeter then honey. At miraz when jibrael (as) took Muhammed (s)
to the heaven, he saw the most beautiful fall, the Kauther. Surahs Fun Facts:

will never be thirsty again. 10. Whoever doesn't follow the sunnah of Muhammad
(s)'s orders, they can not drink the water from the Kauther river. 11. The land under this river will have the most
beautiful smell and tons of tons of diamonds and the most beautiful stones."
"Surah Maun Before Islam came to Makkah, the people were
corrupted. They used to do many bad jobs. So Allah (swt) sent surah Maun to Muhammad
(s) to tell the people how to stay in the right path and what the definition of a true
Muslim was. In this surah Allah (swt) warned us that Muslims
should not do bad jobs. In this Surah Allah (swt) even gave us some
examples. At first Allah (swt) mentioned about orphan
children. As a Muslim we have to take care of any orphan
child, it does not matter if that orphan child is Muslim or Non-Muslim. During the beginning of Prophet Muhammad (s)'s
prophet hood, Abu Jahl cheated with an orphan boy. That orphan boy did not have any clothes to
wear. One day he came to Abu Jahl to get all of
his land and money which his father left for the orphan boy. But bad Abu Jahl refused to give him the money
that belonged to him. The poor little boy did not know what to do. Some of Abu Jahl's friends laughed at the
orphan boy. They even told him to go to Muhammad (s) with
his complain. At that time Abu Jahl and his friends were
giving a very hard time to Muhammad (s) and all of the Muslims. Muslims were very weak at that time. They thought Muhammad (s) could not help that
orphan. That poor boy went to Muhammad (s) and complained
about Abu Jahl. The prophet stood up for him right way and
took the boy to Abu Jahl. He told Abu Jahl to return the orphan’s
money right away. Abu Jahl became afraid and returned the orphan
money right away. Abu Jahl’s friends were surprise to see
that. Later Abu Jahl told them, he saw two spears
with Muhammad (s). One was on his right side and other was his
left side. If Abu Jahl refused to give that orphan his
money, those spears would kill him. In this Surah Allah (swt) also mentioned about
the poor people. As a Muslim we should take care of any poor
people, and it does not matter if they are Muslim or Non-Muslim. If they need food we should give them food
and encourage others to give them food. Later on in the surah Allah (swt) mentioned
to pray from our hearts and not to show off to others. If the prayer time starts we should pray as
soon as possible. If we don't pray from our hearts, Allah (swt)
will not accept our prayer and we will be in big trouble in the day of Judgment. And finally Allah (swt) advises us, to share
any common use items with our neighbors, does not matter if that neighbor is a Muslim or
Non-Muslim. Suppose our neighbor needs some tools, we
should share our tools with them. Even if our neighbor needs a little salt for
their cooking, we should give them that little salt. Fun Facts about Surah Maun:
1. This surah was reveled at Makkah
2. Maun means any common use items
3. Whoever doesn't pray their prayer from their
heart, they are a hypocrite. They are not Muslim, and they pretend to be
Muslim 4. Prophet Muhammad (s) was an orphan boy
5. This Surah shows us the difference between
believers and non believers 6. The name of this Surah came from the last
word of this Surah, Maun"
"89. Surah Al-Fajr (The Dawn / Daybreak)
When Muhammad (s) started to spread Islam&nbsp;&nbsp; openly, the bad Quraysh leaders and&nbsp;
rich people started to a give hard&nbsp;&nbsp; time to the new Muslims. To warn them Allah (swt)&nbsp;
sent surah Fajr with some examples of powerful bad&nbsp;&nbsp; civilizations who were destroyed by Allah (swt).
(1-5) Allah (swt) starts surah Fajr by taking&nbsp;&nbsp; an oath of the early morning, different&nbsp;
parts of the month, even and odd numbers,&nbsp;&nbsp; and night turning into day. For wise people, these&nbsp;
are good examples, of how everything in this world&nbsp;&nbsp; works perfectly. Just like how the sun rises in&nbsp;
the morning and sets at night and how we can tell&nbsp;&nbsp; what day it is. Smart people understand that there&nbsp;
must be a God who is in charge of everything.&nbsp; (6-8) Allah (swt) mentions different groups of&nbsp;
bad people from history. Some groups of people&nbsp;&nbsp; behaved well and were successful, while others&nbsp;
were not so good and ended up in trouble. Here we&nbsp;&nbsp; can learn the mistakes and successes from history.&nbsp;
Allah (swt) mentions the people of 'Ad who lived&nbsp;&nbsp; in the hills. They were physically well-built and&nbsp;
well-known for their tall building construction&nbsp;&nbsp; with big towers. Among all the nations they were&nbsp;
very powerful and wealthy, which, unfortunately,&nbsp;&nbsp; made them arrogant. They worshiped their stone&nbsp;
idols and they did not believe in the Day of&nbsp;&nbsp; Judgment. To guide those people Allah (swt) sent&nbsp;
them Prophet Hud (pbuh). But they did not believe&nbsp;&nbsp; Prophet Hud (as) and kept doing all their bad&nbsp;
actions. So Allah (swt) decided to punish all the&nbsp;&nbsp; bad people. As a punishment, there was no rain.&nbsp;
So a terrible drought spread throughout the land.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, finally, a very heavy sandstorm killed all&nbsp;
the disbelievers. For more details of this story,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can watch our episode of Prophet Hud (as).
(9-10) Unfortunately, some people still don't&nbsp;&nbsp; learn from history. People of Thamud also rejected&nbsp;
Allah (swt) and their Prophet Saleh (as)'s advice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Allah (swt) made them the first nation in&nbsp;
history who cut rocks to build their houses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example is that Allah (swt) made Pharaoh&nbsp;
or Firaun a very powerful king in history. He&nbsp;&nbsp; had a very large and strong army. But after&nbsp;
getting Allah (swt)'s blessing, they became&nbsp;&nbsp; very arrogant and broke Allah (swt)'s law and&nbsp;
orders to destroy the peace with their people.&nbsp; (11-14) Basically, all the bad people&nbsp;
spread crime in their community. They&nbsp;&nbsp; thought nobody was watching them. They&nbsp;
forgot that Allah (swt) is keeping an&nbsp;&nbsp; eye on everything at all times. When the&nbsp;
bad people cross a limit and go too far,&nbsp;&nbsp; Allah (swt) attacks them with a big punishment.
(15-16) Bad people are very ungrateful to Allah&nbsp;&nbsp; (swt). When they have money, fancy things,&nbsp;
and power, they feel really proud. They think&nbsp;&nbsp; they have special blessings and honor from&nbsp;
God. But when they don't get what they want,&nbsp;&nbsp; they feel humiliated and blame God. They think&nbsp;
that money and power make them important. But&nbsp;&nbsp; they don't realize that everything they have is&nbsp;
actually a test from God. Allah (swt) made the&nbsp;&nbsp; people of Ad, Thamud, and Pharaoh very powerful to&nbsp;
see if they would become thankful to God and how&nbsp;&nbsp; they would use their wealth and power. If some&nbsp;
people are not so lucky, it's still a test to&nbsp;&nbsp; see if they'll keep patience with Allah (swt).
(17-20) Allah (swt) sees how we treat orphans&nbsp;&nbsp; and poor people. This is our duty to help them&nbsp;
with our money and wealth. But the bad people&nbsp;&nbsp; are very greedy to become more rich. Some of them&nbsp;
even don't have respect for the dead people and&nbsp;&nbsp; their families. They are greedy to grab the dead&nbsp;
person's assets and money to become more rich.&nbsp; (21) They think there would be no effect for&nbsp;
their bad action. Allah (swt) will not let&nbsp;&nbsp; them go that easily. All of their good and bad&nbsp;
action will be judged on the Day of Judgment&nbsp;&nbsp; and that day is real. It will happen at&nbsp;
the right time. To prepare for that day&nbsp;&nbsp; Allah (sw) will destroy this world into powder.
(22-30) On the day of Judgment, they will see the&nbsp;&nbsp; almighty Allah (swt) and angels who will wait&nbsp;
with discipline. They also will see the scary&nbsp;&nbsp; Hellfire. They will realize that the day of&nbsp;
Judgment is real, but it'll be too late. There&nbsp;&nbsp; will be no hope and way to save them except Allah&nbsp;
(swt)'s mercy. They will start to cry for fear and&nbsp;&nbsp; be sorry for their bad actions. They will wish&nbsp;
that they could do more good jobs in this world.&nbsp; On that day Allah (swt) will be very&nbsp;
angry with the bad people and tie them&nbsp;&nbsp; very tightly to throw them to the&nbsp;
Hellfire with extreme punishment.&nbsp; But Allah (swt) will be very happy for the good&nbsp;
people who followed Allah (swt)'s law and order,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Quran. He will send their souls to&nbsp;
Paradise where they will live happily forever. Important Facts of Al-Fajr

"Surah Al-Fatihah
Long long ago it was the time around the year of 610, when people of Mecca did not follow
Allah (swt)'s law. The house of Kaba was filled with 360 different
idols. From different countries people came to the
Kabah to worship those idols. So Allah (swt) chose Muhammed (pbuh) as the
last and final prophet to guide the whole world. Surah Fatihah was the first complete Surah
Allah (swt) gave to his final messenger. The meaning of Fatihah is the opening. So this is the opening of the Quran. Surah Fatihah also the summarized the whole
Quran. So it also called the mother of the Quran. This surah also has many other names. Surah Fatiha is a very beautiful Dua or prayer. If we want to understand the Quran or get
benefit from the Quran we should read this Dua or prayer to Allah (swt). In this surah we are asking something to Allah
(swt) and Allah (swt) gave the answer in the whole Quran. For example, in this surah we are asking Allah
(swt) to show us the right path. So Allah (swt) gave us the Quran so we can
be on the right path. Allah (swt) divided this surah into two parts. The first part is for Allah (swt). In this part we are admiring the power of
Allah (swt). And the last part is for us, where we are
begging help from the one and only God Allah (swt). This is the best Surah than any other book
Allah (swt) send for us from Adam (pbuh) to Muhammed ( Pbuh) combined. Even in the Quran, Surah Fatiha is the most
powerful Surah. One day Angel Jibril (pbuh) was with prophet
Muhammed (pbuh). They heard a loud noise from the sky and saw
that one of the doors of the heaven was opened, which was never opened before. An angel came from that door to prophet Muhammed
(pbuh) and gave him good news about two special lights. Allah (swt) gave those lights to Muhammed
(pbuh) as a gift which no other prophet got before. One of those lights was surah Fatiha and other
light was the last three sentences of Surah Al Baqarah. Once, a group of Sahaba were in a journey. A female servant came to them and said that
the leader of that area became very sick because he was poisoned. She was asking help from the sahabas. One sahaba went to the leader and recited
surah Fatihah. With Allah (swt)'s blessing the leader's health
improved. The chief was so happy that he gave 30 sheeps
and lots of milk to the sahabas. That's why, in every prayer we have to read
surah Fatiha. Without this surah no prayer is accepted by
Allah (swt). In prayer when we read each sentence of surah
Fatiha, Allah (swt) replies to us for each sentence that we recite. That's why in prayer we should read this surah
very slowly. Fun Fact:
1. Surah Fatiha was the first complete surah
of the Quran 2. Surah Fatiha is the best Dua
3. This is the Best surah from Adam (as) to Muhammad
(as) combined 4. This Surah is Special Light from heaven. 5. Without this Surah, prayer is not accepted
6. Allah (swt) replies for every sentence of
this surah that  we recite"
"92. Surah Al Lail (The Night) Allah (swt) sent Surah Al-Lail in Makkah&nbsp;
when Prophet Muhammad (s) openly started&nbsp;&nbsp; inviting people to Islam. He tried teaching the&nbsp;
people about good actions and bad actions and&nbsp;&nbsp; how Allah (swt) helps us find good actions with&nbsp;
our feelings and with the guidebook, the Quran. (1-4) Allah (swt) starts Surah Lail&nbsp;
with an oath about the night and day,&nbsp;&nbsp; and boys and girls. All these things are&nbsp;
different and opposite. People's goals&nbsp;&nbsp; and work can also be different and opposite.&nbsp;
To understand the goals and actions better,&nbsp;&nbsp; Allah (swt) compares them into two groups.&nbsp;
One group is good and the other group is bad. (5-6) The good group does three good actions.&nbsp;
First, they spend money in a good way by donating&nbsp;&nbsp; to poor people and doing good actions to please&nbsp;
Allah (swt). Second, is having strong faith in&nbsp;&nbsp; Allah (swt). If our Iman or faith is strong,&nbsp;
it will help us to be a good person in our&nbsp;&nbsp; everyday life. Third is believing in goodness. We&nbsp;
should always be an honest person and follow the&nbsp;&nbsp; good system of Allah (swt). That system is in the&nbsp;
Quran which covers everything in an organized way. (7) If we do good things we can feel&nbsp;
good, like being kind, helping others,&nbsp;&nbsp; and not doing bad things. That way we’d&nbsp;
be living in a peaceful and happy society&nbsp;&nbsp; where people respect and are grateful&nbsp;
to each other too. When we do good,&nbsp;&nbsp; Allah (swt) also makes it easy&nbsp;
for us to do more good actions. (8-9) But the bad group of people tries to live&nbsp;
in the opposite way. They are very greedy and&nbsp;&nbsp; keep all their money for themselves. They&nbsp;
don't spend their money for a good cause,&nbsp;&nbsp; like helping others or doing things for the&nbsp;
community. They don't care about what makes Allah&nbsp;&nbsp; (swt) happy. They focus only on worldly stuff&nbsp;
and don't think about what's right or wrong in&nbsp;&nbsp; Allah (swt)'s eyes. They don't even believe in&nbsp;
doing good things for people or the community. (10) That is a very bad way to live life. This way&nbsp;
people do anything for their own money, enjoyment,&nbsp;&nbsp; and worldly success, but they do everything&nbsp;
against Allah (swt)'s law and order. Once&nbsp;&nbsp; they become shameless by doing all kinds of bad&nbsp;
jobs, it becomes very easy for them to do wrong&nbsp;&nbsp; things. And then it becomes very hard for them&nbsp;
to do good things for themselves or the society. (11) But when they die, they cannot&nbsp;
take their money or big houses or&nbsp;&nbsp; cool cars with them into the graves. So we need to&nbsp;&nbsp; spend our money in a good way so we can&nbsp;
get the rewards on the day of Judgment. (12) Allah (swt) knows what is good and what&nbsp;
is bad for us. He gave us the best guidebook,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Quran. This guidebook tells us the right&nbsp;&nbsp; things to do and avoid the wrong&nbsp;
things to become a good person. (13) As you know, Allah (swt) is in charge&nbsp;
of everything in this world and hereafter.&nbsp;&nbsp; No matter if people do good jobs or bad&nbsp;
jobs, Allah is still in charge of both&nbsp;&nbsp; worlds. If we make mistakes, it doesn't harm&nbsp;
Allah; it harms ourselves. And if we do good,&nbsp;&nbsp; it doesn't benefit Allah. It benefits us.&nbsp;
Allah (swt) is the Boss of everything. If we&nbsp;&nbsp; want something in this world or the hereafter,&nbsp;
only Allah (swt) has the power to give that. (14-18) But for bad people who don't follow&nbsp;
Allah (swt)'s law and order, their final&nbsp;&nbsp; destination is in burning Hellfire. Only Allah&nbsp;
(swt) will save good people from that Hellfire. (19-20) Those good people will help others&nbsp;
without expecting anything in return. They&nbsp;&nbsp; do it just to make Allah (swt) happy. One&nbsp;
of the great examples is Abu Bakr (r). He&nbsp;&nbsp; used to buy and free the Muslim slaves&nbsp;
from their very bad owners. One day his&nbsp;&nbsp; father asked why he didn't spend his money&nbsp;
on strong young slaves who could help him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Abu Bakr (r) said he was doing this&nbsp;
for Allah (swt)'s reward, and not for&nbsp;&nbsp; any personal worldly gains. He was helping&nbsp;
others because it was the right thing to do. (21) If we do good things only&nbsp;
for Allah (swt), as a reward,&nbsp;&nbsp; he will send us to Heaven, and we&nbsp;
will become very happy forever. Important Facts of Surah Al-Lail

"94 Surah Al-Inshirah or Ash-Sharh (The Relief)
During the beginning of Muhammad (s)'s&nbsp;&nbsp; prophethood, he was spreading Islam secretly.&nbsp;
To change all the people and entire society,&nbsp;&nbsp; was a very difficult job for Muhammad&nbsp;
(s). To help and encourage him,&nbsp;&nbsp; Allah (swt) sent this Surah Al-Inshirah.&nbsp;
In the beginning, Allah (swt) talked about&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 great gifts for Prophet Muhammad (s).
(1) The first gift was cleaning his heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Prophet Muhammad (s) received this great gift&nbsp;
during his childhood. One day he was playing&nbsp;&nbsp; with some children near his foster mother Halema&nbsp;
(r)'s house. The prophet was only 4 years old&nbsp;&nbsp; when suddenly angel Jibreel (as) came and laid&nbsp;
him down and opened his chest. Jibreel (pbuh)&nbsp;&nbsp; took out his heart and cut off some of the parts&nbsp;
so that it would save him from Shaytan. Then he&nbsp;&nbsp; washed his heart with the Zamzam water and put his&nbsp;
heart back into its place. This process saved the&nbsp;&nbsp; prophet so he would not get confused about any&nbsp;
kind of false gods. That’s why in his lifetime,&nbsp;&nbsp; he never worshipped any idols. Sometimes the&nbsp;
‘open heart’ does not mean physically opening&nbsp;&nbsp; the body. Basically, another meaning is for the&nbsp;
heart to become open so that it can accept the&nbsp;&nbsp; truth. Because only with an open heart someone&nbsp;
can truly understand Islam in a better way.&nbsp; Another meaning of an 'open heart' is to make the&nbsp;
heart very strong and brave. That open brave heart&nbsp;&nbsp; can save us from evil. For example, we know Musa&nbsp;
(as) left the Egyptian palace for around ten&nbsp;&nbsp; years and lived in his father-in-law's village.&nbsp;
Then Musa (as) suddenly decided to return to the&nbsp;&nbsp; main Egypt center with his wife. On the way,&nbsp;
they were lost but Allah (swt) guided them to&nbsp;&nbsp; reach Mount Tur. At night, he saw a fire in the&nbsp;
distance. After Allah (swt) showed some miracles&nbsp;&nbsp; to Musa(as), Allah (swt) ordered him to go to his&nbsp;
people and save them from the evil Pharaoh. In&nbsp;&nbsp; Surah Taha, there Prophet Musa (as) requested&nbsp;
to Allah (swt) to open his heart and increase&nbsp;&nbsp; his braveness so he could do his work easily.
(2-3) Allah (swt)'s 2nd gift to the prophet&nbsp;&nbsp; Muhammad (s) was removing his sadness and&nbsp;
worries from his heart. Before Muhammad (s)&nbsp;&nbsp; became a prophet, his heart was very sad and&nbsp;
heavy. He could not believe how the people did&nbsp;&nbsp; all kinds of bad jobs and how they followed&nbsp;
the idols as their gods. His heavy heart was&nbsp;&nbsp; looking for the real God, Allah (swt).&nbsp;
That’s when he used to spend more and&nbsp;&nbsp; more time alone in cave Hira in Mount Noor.&nbsp;
One day Angel Jibrael (as) came to the cave&nbsp;&nbsp; with the first part of surah Alaq. Jibrael&nbsp;
(as) held and pressed Muhammad (s) 3 times&nbsp;&nbsp; to make his heart strong and remove all&nbsp;
of his sadness and worries, so he could&nbsp;&nbsp; do his difficult job. Spreading Islam, easily.
(4) Later Allah (swt) promised to give his 3rd&nbsp;&nbsp; special gift. Which will be to make Prophet&nbsp;
Muhammad (s) very famous and and make him the&nbsp;&nbsp; most respected person in this world. When Allah&nbsp;
(swt) sent this surah, no one could ever believe&nbsp;&nbsp; that Muhammad (s) would be that famous. Because&nbsp;
at that time, only a few people followed him,&nbsp;&nbsp; and no one knew his name outside of Makkah. But&nbsp;
the evil people from Makkah spread bad information&nbsp;&nbsp; about Muhammad (s) everywhere including when&nbsp;
people came for Hajj from other cities. And&nbsp;&nbsp; day by day his name was spreading all&nbsp;
over Arabia. Even in our present day,&nbsp;&nbsp; almost everywhere in the world, every single&nbsp;
moment someone mentions the prophet Muhammad&nbsp;&nbsp; (s)'s name in their Athan and their prayers.
(5-6) We need to understand when we try to&nbsp;&nbsp; spread Islam, we might face some problems&nbsp;
and troubles. So Allah (swt) gives us very&nbsp;&nbsp; powerful advice by repeating it two times saying&nbsp;
that no matter how difficult our situation is,&nbsp;&nbsp; he will always save us. Our hardship and&nbsp;
difficult time will not stay long. So we should&nbsp;&nbsp; keep our strong faith in Allah (swt) and stay&nbsp;
patient for our good time to come Insha’Allah.&nbsp; (7-8) Basically our job is to work for Allah&nbsp;
(swt). We need to spread Islam to everyone&nbsp;&nbsp; and apply it in our lives. When we have free&nbsp;
time, should be grateful for his blessing and&nbsp;&nbsp; gifts. We should give thanks to Allah (swt)&nbsp;
for saving us from evil and hard times. One&nbsp;&nbsp; of the best ways to thank Allah (swt) is to pray&nbsp;
extra prayers. It will help us to come closer to&nbsp;&nbsp; our creator and our life will be successful in&nbsp;
this world and the day of Judgment, InshaAllah. Important Facts of Surah Al-Inshirah or Ash-Sharh
The name of this surah came from&nbsp;&nbsp; the first sentence of the Surah.
Allah (swt) sent this Surah in Makkah&nbsp;&nbsp; during the beginning of the prophethood.
Right after Surah Duha, Allah (swt) sent&nbsp;&nbsp; this Surah, Al-Inshirah.
Surah Inshirah means to&nbsp;&nbsp; comfort or open the heart or relief.
Surah Inshirah has only 8 short sentences.&nbsp; Allah (swt) gave 3 things to prophet&nbsp;
Muhammad (s), a powerful heart,&nbsp;&nbsp; solved all of his problems, and gave him&nbsp;
the highest fame and honor in human history.&nbsp; This surah was to challenge the bad people who&nbsp;
wanted to stop the Prophet from spreading Islam."
"Gardens of Nothing
Once upon a time,&nbsp;&nbsp; there was a man who owned two beautiful gardens.&nbsp;
One garden had tall date palms, and the other&nbsp;&nbsp; was full of juicy grapevines. Everyone was very&nbsp;
jealous to see those beautiful fruits. The man&nbsp;&nbsp; took great care of his gardens. He spent lots of&nbsp;
time taking care of his two gardens every single&nbsp;&nbsp; day and watered his garden trees from a nearby&nbsp;
stream. He was very happy with his hard work and&nbsp;&nbsp; he loved showing off his gardens to his guests and&nbsp;
told them about the different fruits that he grew.&nbsp; But day by day the man became more proud and&nbsp;
arrogant. He forgot that it was Allah who gave him&nbsp;&nbsp; these beautiful gardens. He thought that he only&nbsp;
became successful because of his own hard work,&nbsp;&nbsp; so he was not grateful to Allah (swt) at all.
Then one day, when he was walking by his gardens.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly he heard a voice reminding him that&nbsp;
all of his wealth and success was a gift from&nbsp;&nbsp; Allah (swt). The man was shocked, but he ignored&nbsp;
the voice, thinking it was nothing. But again,&nbsp;&nbsp; the voice repeated and said the same thing,&nbsp;
but he didn’t care. Soon after, a strong wind&nbsp;&nbsp; blew and started destroying everything in&nbsp;
the man's garden. In just a short time,&nbsp;&nbsp; all of his success was completely gone and&nbsp;
destroyed. All he had were gardens of nothing,&nbsp;&nbsp; and this made him extremely sad. And he realized&nbsp;
that all of this happened because he became too&nbsp;&nbsp; proud and forgot about Allah (swt)'s&nbsp;
blessings. He realized his mistake and&nbsp;&nbsp; right away asked forgiveness from Allah (swt),&nbsp;
and he promised Allah(swt) that from now on he&nbsp;&nbsp; would do good things and be grateful to all of us.
From that point, the man became a very good Muslim&nbsp;&nbsp; and started to follow Allah (swt) law and order.&nbsp;
Using the money that he still had left over from&nbsp;&nbsp; his gardens, he used it to help others by building&nbsp;
a mosque and a school for the local community.&nbsp;&nbsp; He spent the rest of his life teaching others why&nbsp;
it is so important to be thankful to Allah (swt).&nbsp; This story from Ibn Kathir reminds us that&nbsp;
everything we have is a gift from Allah (swt). We&nbsp;&nbsp; should always be grateful for what we have because&nbsp;
that is what he gave us. We should always use our&nbsp;&nbsp; money for Allah (swt) and to help others. May&nbsp;
Allah (swt) protect us from being greedy, Ameen."
"Surah Quraish
Long long ago, before Muhammad (s) was even born, our story starts from his great great
great grandfather and his name was Kusai. Before his time the people of Quraish did
not live in unity. So he united the Quraish in Makkah. Day by day Makkah turn to city. Kusai always treated people as a guest whomever
visited to the house of Allah (swt) from all over Arabia. So day by day among the Arabian tribes and
lands, Quraish was getting more powerful. His son Abdi Manaf increased the Quraish power
even higher throughout the Arabia and one of his sons was Hashim. Hashim was very respected and generous. He used to take care of the people who ever
came to Makkah for Hajj and distribute food to them. He was a businessman and for his business,
during the winter he used to travel to Yemen and during the summer he used to go Syria. He had very good connections with these two
countries. Every where people of Quraish got special
favors and was respected because during the hajj time they treat the people in a very
good way. So on their business journey no one attacked
them. In whole Arabia they could do the business
very safely. Day by day Makkah became the most important
business center. Allah (swt) made the Quraish the most respectful
people. One of Hashim's sons name was Abdul Muttalib. During his time the Governor of Yemen, Abraha
became very greedy to take control of Makkah. At just one excuse, he was ready to attacked
Makkah with a very big army. But Allah (swt) destroyed them just by birds. At that time, Rome and Persian empires were
very powerful. That miracle was the big alarm to the whole
world. To warn them not to attack Makkah. By this event, Allah (swt) gave to the Quraish
highest level respect. So in this surah Quraish Allah (swt) is telling
the people of Quraish to be grateful to him and accept Islam. Surahs Fun Facts:
1. Allah (swt) send this Surah in Makkah.
2. Al beginning some of the Sahabies thought
Surah Fil and Surah Quraish were one surah. 3. Kusai was called ""Mujammi"" because he unite
the people of Quraish Tribe in Makkah. 4. People of Quraish were the caretaker of Kabba
for many generation. Specially it was started from Kusai, one of
the important leader of Quraish. 5. People of Quraish had most educated people
in whole Arabia. 6. Before Quraish, people of Himyar control  the Arabia."
"The Rich Arrogant Man – Qarun Today we will talk about a story from the Quran in&nbsp;
Surah Qasas. There once was a rich man named Qarun&nbsp;&nbsp; also known as Korah during Prophet Musa (as)’s&nbsp;
time. He used to have a huge fancy palace and&nbsp;&nbsp; wore very expensive clothes. He had many slaves&nbsp;
too and treated them very badly. He was so rich&nbsp;&nbsp; that it was even hard for a group of strong men&nbsp;
to carry the keys to his treasure boxes. Some&nbsp;&nbsp; scholars say that 10 strong men could only carry&nbsp;
one key together, but Allah(swt) knows the best. The good and pious people warned Qarun and&nbsp;
told him not to be arrogant. They told him&nbsp;&nbsp; to be generous with his money like Allah (swt) was&nbsp;
generous to him so that he could go to Jannah. But&nbsp;&nbsp; Qarun was greedy and wanted to keep all of his&nbsp;
money for himself. Good people also told him not&nbsp;&nbsp; to spread corruption and do bad jobs. But Qarun&nbsp;
did not listen. To cause chaos and corruption,&nbsp;&nbsp; he even paid a woman to lie and tell the people&nbsp;
that Musa (as) did bad jobs with her. Musa(as)&nbsp;&nbsp; was so upset and prayed to Allah to ask for&nbsp;
help. Musa (as) went to the woman and asked&nbsp;&nbsp; why she did that. The woman started crying and&nbsp;
told him that the evil Qarun convinced her to&nbsp;&nbsp; lie to try to ruin Musa (as)’s reputation. She&nbsp;
immediately asked Allah (swt) for forgiveness. But Qarun was not sorry. He just thought he&nbsp;
was being smart. He told the people that he&nbsp;&nbsp; was so rich because of his knowledge.&nbsp;
He was arrogant and did not give Allah&nbsp;&nbsp; (swt) any credit. Then to show off, he&nbsp;
decided to have a huge parade with all&nbsp;&nbsp; of his riches. People saw all of his&nbsp;
stuff and were shocked. Some of them&nbsp;&nbsp; even started to wish that they were rich&nbsp;
like Qarun. The good people told them,&nbsp;&nbsp; “Shame on you! The Reward of Allâh (swt) is better&nbsp;
for those who believe and do good deeds.” And told&nbsp;&nbsp; them that the patient people would be able to&nbsp;
receive that reward in the hereafter inshaAllah. Finally, Allah decided to punish Qarun. Suddenly&nbsp;
the Earth split open and swallowed Qarun,&nbsp;&nbsp; his mansion, and all of his riches. The&nbsp;
evil people that used to support him also&nbsp;&nbsp; was swallowed by the Earth. Then the Earth&nbsp;
closed and it seemed like everything was&nbsp;&nbsp; back to normal and Qarun and his wealth&nbsp;
never existed. The people then realized&nbsp;&nbsp; that Allah is in charge of everything,&nbsp;
and he decides on what he gives and takes&nbsp;&nbsp; away from us. They were grateful that&nbsp;
Allah didn’t make the Earth swallow&nbsp;&nbsp; them too and realized that the disbelievers&nbsp;
and bad people would never be successful. This story from Surah Qasas verses 76-83 is&nbsp;
a great reminder that Allah has power over&nbsp;&nbsp; everything. It is also a reminder that just&nbsp;
because someone is more rich does not mean&nbsp;&nbsp; Allah loves them better. Allah even mentions&nbsp;
in the Quran that there were more people who&nbsp;&nbsp; were even richer and stronger than Qarun&nbsp;
generations before him but Allah destroyed&nbsp;&nbsp; them. Allah can test us in different&nbsp;
ways. He might take away our money or&nbsp;&nbsp; give us more money to see what we will do. Either&nbsp;
way, it is important that we use whatever money we&nbsp;&nbsp; have in a good way. Allah(swt) also made the&nbsp;
rule for Muslims to give zakat which is the&nbsp;&nbsp; 3rd pillar of Islam to help us not become selfish&nbsp;
and arrogant like Qarun. All Muslims are supposed&nbsp;&nbsp; to give away 2.5% of their wealth or money. Poor&nbsp;
people do not have to give zakat but they do have&nbsp;&nbsp; to give Zakat-ul-Fitr at the end of Ramadan. To&nbsp;
learn more about zakat and zakat-ul-Fitr, check&nbsp;&nbsp; out our Ramadan lesson #19 in the description&nbsp;
below. May Allah protect us from being greedy&nbsp;&nbsp; and arrogant, and help us use our money in a good&nbsp;
way to go to the highest level of Jannah. Ameen."
"The Powerful King &amp; the Ants Long ago, there was a Prophet named Sulieman&nbsp;
(as) also known as Soloman (pbuh). He was a&nbsp;&nbsp; powerful king in the Levant area which&nbsp;
includes parts of modern-day Palestine,&nbsp;&nbsp; Jordan, and Syria. Allah blessed Prophet&nbsp;
Sulaiman (as) with many gifts such as&nbsp;&nbsp; controlling the wind and Jinns. Jinns live&nbsp;
in tribes, eat, drink, and can choose to be&nbsp;&nbsp; bad or good like human. We cannot see them but&nbsp;
Allah (swt) gave Sulaiman (as) special power&nbsp;&nbsp; to see and talk to them. Allah (swt) also&nbsp;
gave him the power to talk to animals&nbsp;&nbsp; too. There is a story of this in the Quran&nbsp;
Chapter 27, Surah Al-Naml in verses 18-19. One day prophet Sulaiman (as) gathered his huge&nbsp;
army in three groups. One group was an army of&nbsp;&nbsp; men. Another group was an army of Jinns and the&nbsp;
other group was an army of birds. The army of&nbsp;&nbsp; birds was protecting the other groups from&nbsp;
the hot sun. One time they were going to one&nbsp;&nbsp; place and on the way an ant saw King Sulaiman's&nbsp;
army. The ant cried out to warn the other ants,&nbsp; ""Run to your homes! Otherwise, Sulaiman (as)&nbsp;
and his army might crush you accidentally!""&nbsp; Prophet Sulaiman (pbuh) heard the ant&nbsp;
and smiled. He ordered his army to be&nbsp;&nbsp; careful of the ants. Sulaiman (pbuh)&nbsp;
became very grateful to Allah (swt) for&nbsp;&nbsp; giving him the ability to understand the&nbsp;
ant's language and save the ants' lives. The story of Prophet Sulaiman (as) and the&nbsp;
ants teaches us three important things. First,&nbsp;&nbsp; it reminds us to be kind to all creatures, no&nbsp;
matter how small they are. Second, it teaches&nbsp;&nbsp; us about being humble no matter how powerful we&nbsp;
become. Even though Suleiman was a powerful king,&nbsp;&nbsp; he stopped to make sure the little ants were okay.&nbsp;
Finally, this story reminds us to take care of&nbsp;&nbsp; our planet and all the creatures on it. There is&nbsp;
even a hadith from Sahih al-Bukhari where Prophet&nbsp;&nbsp; Muhammad(s) said, “There is a reward for serving&nbsp;
(or caring for) any living being.” As Muslims,&nbsp;&nbsp; we believe it is our job to take care of&nbsp;
the Earth and everything living on it. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; we should always be kind, humble, and&nbsp;
responsible towards all living beings. This is the end of our story from the Quran&nbsp;
for today. If you’d like to learn more about&nbsp;&nbsp; the powerful Prophet Sulaiman (as) and all&nbsp;
of his blessings make sure to check out&nbsp;&nbsp; our prophet story series and see in the&nbsp;
description down below! AssalamuAlaikum."
"Surah Al-Alaq
Around 1400 year ago, the Arab society was in a very dark time. People and society needed a light to bring
peace around them. At that time a young Arab man was looking
for the real God who could bring peace in his society. That young Arab man was Muhammad (s). During his lifetime he never worshiped any
idols. Whenever he stayed alone, he was in deep thought
about God's creation. To find the real God, at the age of 38, he
started to spend the whole Ramadan month alone in Mount Noor, at the small cave called Hira. At the age of 40 during Ramadan time just
before sunrise, Angel Jibrael (as) came to Muhammad (s) and said to him, ""Read"". Muhammad (s) became very scared and replied
that he cannot read. Angel Jibrael (as) held and pressed him very
hard and told him again to read. Again Muhammad (s) replied that he cannot
read. The angel held him and pressed him again very
hard. Then told Muhammad (s) to read. Muhammad (s) again said he cannot read. For the third time the Angel held and pressed
him again very hard and told Muhammad (s), ""read in the name of your lord who created
everything"". The angel Jibrael (as) gave first five sentence
of Surah Alaq. That was the first time prophet Muhammad (s)
started to receive the final and last Holy books of Allah (swt). For the details of the story you can see episode
4 of our complete prophet Muhammad (s) story. (1) Some scholar believe that Jibrail (as)
brought the part of surah Alaq in some kind of written format. That why prophet replied that he could not
read. But Allah (swt) knows best. But here we need to understand one thing that,
Allah (swt)'s first order to us is to get knowledge. Allah (swt) doesn’t want us to be a blind
Muslims. Education is one of the most important parts
of Islam. When we read we should remember Allah (swt)
for his help. Only he can give us the right and useful knowledge
of everything because he created everything in the Universe.
(2) He created us in a complex way with just a little drop of body fluid. Here Allah (swt) gave us lots of scientific
information just by using the word 'Alaq', which we did not know for a long, long time. After 1400 years, the latest technology about
embryology helped the scientist to find the deeper meaning of Alaq. Many scientists became very surprise by the
new discovery and started to believe that the Quran is truly a Holy book by Allah (swt). (3-5) The human did not know about anything. All the knowledge we have are from Allah (swt). Quran is the original source of real knowledge. This is the one of the greatest gifts to us
from Allah (swt). He also gave us knowledge about how to use
the pen. With the pen or writing we could spread our
knowledge to whole world from generation to generation. Even the Quran did not change for longest
time because it was written down. The first five sentences of Surah Alaq mainly
talk about the real knowledge which we can get by reading with Allah (swt)'s help. The rest of the surah, verse 6-19, Allah (swt)
sent few a months later when Muhammad (s) started to pray openly in front of Kabah. Bad people, especially the bad Abu Jahl did
not like it. Whenever Muhammad (s) tried to pray at Kabah
Abu Jahl always tried to stop him. One day Muhammad (s) was praying at Kabah,
and after seeing that, Abu Jahl became extremely angry. But, when Abu Jahl tried to hurt the prophet
(s), he saw a big fire with some wings. He got really scared and went back to his
friends. (6-8) This story is an example of how the
bad people are very ungrateful to their creator. When the bad people became rich and powerful,
they thought that they can do anything and everything. Sometimes, they would even challenge their
creator. They forgot that all of their knowledge and
power is a gift from Allah (swt). They forgot that Allah (swt) created them
just from a little drop of body liquid. And one day we have to die to return to our
creator Allah (swt). (9-14) Then Allah (swt) directly warns the
bad people who are like Abu Jahl. Every society had some bad people like Abu
Jahl. During prophet Ibrahim (as)'s time Nomrud
was there, during Musa (as)'s time pharaoh was there, during Jesus or Isa (as)'s time
some very bad Bani Israel was there, during Muhammad (s)'s time some bad Qurayish was
there. Same way in present day, we will see there
are some people who try to stop Muslims who follow Allah (swt)'s law and order. Here Allah (swt) is not talking about the
general Muslims. Here Allah (swt) is talking about the strong
practicing Muslims who are trying to spread Islam and follow Allah (swt) law and order. Shaytan definitely doesn’t like those kind
of good Muslims. So Shaytan tries to make a group of bad people
like Abu Jahl, who are rich and powerful in society. Their main goal is to stop Islam and destroy
the peace in the society. But Allah (swt) sees all of their actions
and records it. (15-16) Allah (swt) became very angry to those
bad people who hate the Islam and try to give hard time to the good Muslims. Allah (swt) warns them, if they don't stop
their hatred, He will drag them by their hair to the Hell fire in a very insulting way. (17-18) They may be powerful in this world
for a short time, but in the long run they will suffer and be destroyed. On the Day of Judgment their group will be
destroyed by the Angels of Hell fire. (19) Finally Allah (swt) gives hope and strength
to those good Muslims who are trying to spread Islam and follow Quran and Sunnah. Good Muslims should not worry about the evil
people and power. As a Muslim we should only follow Allah (swt)'s
order and pray to him for our every need and help. Because only with prayer we can come closer
to Allah (swt). Surah Alaq talks about two major important
things. One is to get true knowledge and second is
not to be rebellious or disobedient to Islam. Important Facts of Surah Al-Alaq
1. The Quran started by Surah Alaq's first 5
sentences. 2. Allah (swt)'s first order to us is 'Read'
or Study. 3. Muhammad (s) first heard Jibrail (as) voice
by Surah Alaq. 4. Muhammad (s)'s official prophet hood started
from Surah Alaq. 5. Surah Alaq has 19 short sentences. 6. Alaq means to 'hold tight'.
7. The name of this surah came from the last
word of the 2nd sentence. 8. This surah was revealed in Makkah.
9. Muhammad (s) first presented Islam to general
people by Prayer. 10. For prayer, Non-Muslim started the first clash
or argument with Muslims. So with all of this Quranic information, may
Allah help us understand the lessons of Surah Al-Alaq and apply the lessons into our life. Ameen"

"The Baker’s Dua During the Golden Age of Islam, in the 8th and&nbsp;
9th centuries, there was a famous scholar named&nbsp;&nbsp; Ahmad ibn Hanbal (r). Imam Ahmad (r) was born in&nbsp;
Baghdad, Iraq in 780 AD. When he was still a baby,&nbsp;&nbsp; his father died so he was raised by a single&nbsp;
mother. Imam Ahmad and his mother struggled a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; and lived a simple life. His mom introduced him to&nbsp;
Islam from a young age and explained that what we&nbsp;&nbsp; have in this life does not matter. What matters is&nbsp;
what we do in this life to make Allah(swt) happy.&nbsp;&nbsp; So he would always go to the masjid to learn more&nbsp;
about Islam and when he was around 15 years old&nbsp;&nbsp; he started studying more in-depth about the&nbsp;
teachings of our last Prophet Muhammad(s),&nbsp;&nbsp; also known as the hadith. As he got older,&nbsp;
he became one of the most famous scholars in&nbsp;&nbsp; the whole Muslim Ummah at that time. He was a&nbsp;
humble man and would travel to many different&nbsp;&nbsp; places to gain knowledge. One time, he traveled&nbsp;
to Syria and decided to rest at a masjid for the&nbsp;&nbsp; night. The masjid guard came to Imam Ahmad and&nbsp;
told him that he could not stay there. So Imam&nbsp;&nbsp; Ahmad decided to sleep outside the masjid. The&nbsp;
guard did not know who he was and angrily dragged&nbsp;&nbsp; Imam Ahmad by his legs to the road. Imam Ahmad&nbsp;
did not know what to do since he did not have&nbsp;&nbsp; a place to stay. There was a baker across the&nbsp;
road who saw what happened. The kind baker told&nbsp;&nbsp; Imam Ahmad that he could stay at his bakery&nbsp;
for the night since he had more work to do. The whole night, Imam Ahmad noticed the baker&nbsp;
doing dhikr while working. He kept saying&nbsp; SubhanAllah (Glory be to Allah),&nbsp;&nbsp; Alhamdulillah (All praise is for Allah), La ilaaha&nbsp;
il Allah (There is no God but Allah), and Allahu&nbsp;&nbsp; Akbar (Allah is the greatest). Imam Ahmad asked&nbsp;
him, “How long have you been making tasbeeh of&nbsp;&nbsp; Allah?”. The baker said: “My whole life.” The&nbsp;
imam asked him, “What blessings did you notice&nbsp;&nbsp; from Allah since you do so much dhikr?” The baker&nbsp;
told Imam Ahmad that Allah answered all of his&nbsp;&nbsp; dua. Iman Ahmad was surprised! “You got ALL of&nbsp;
your dua’s answered?” The baker told him that&nbsp;&nbsp; all of his dua’s came true except one. “And what&nbsp;
was that?” the Imam asked. The baker told him:&nbsp;&nbsp; “To have a chance to see Imam Ahmad”. Imam&nbsp;
Ahmad hugged the baker with tears in his&nbsp;&nbsp; eyes and told him Allah made that dua come true&nbsp;
as well and that he was Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal. This story shows us the power of dhikr and that&nbsp;
Allah can make any dua come true. Especially in&nbsp;&nbsp; this holy month of Ramadan make sure to make extra&nbsp;
dhikr and pray to Allah for anything that you&nbsp;&nbsp; want. Even if Allah does not answer your dua in&nbsp;
this world since he knows it will not be good for&nbsp;&nbsp; you, inshallah he with answer it in the hereafter.&nbsp;
May Allah make it easy for us to constantly&nbsp;&nbsp; do dhikr like the baker in this story and have&nbsp;
all of our duas answered inshallah. Ameen."
"The Woman Who Didn’t Sleep at Night This story is from Sahih al-Bukhari and Muslim&nbsp;
Hadith Sharif. Long ago, during the time of&nbsp;&nbsp; Prophet Muhammad(s) there was a woman named&nbsp;
Al-Hawlaa’ bint Tuwayt. She loved Allah very&nbsp;&nbsp; much. So, she started to stay up every night to&nbsp;
worship Allah (swt) and would not sleep! One day&nbsp;&nbsp; she was at Aisha(r)’s house who was the wife of&nbsp;
the Prophet. When the Prophet came home he asked&nbsp;&nbsp; Aisha(r) who that woman was. Aisha(r) told him&nbsp;
that she was Al-Hawlaa’(r) and she never sleeps&nbsp;&nbsp; at night so she could pray instead. The Prophet&nbsp;
was shocked. He then said that we should only&nbsp;&nbsp; do what we can handle. And Allah (swt) like our&nbsp;
actions which we do regularly even if it is small. What this means is that a Lot of times people focus on doing big, good jobs&nbsp;
like Al-Hawlaa’. This is good but a lot of times&nbsp;&nbsp; it is not possible to continue doing it every day.&nbsp;
For example, during the last 10 nights of Ramadan,&nbsp;&nbsp; many people do itikaaf which means that they&nbsp;
do not leave the masjid for few days and&nbsp;&nbsp; do ibadah, or worship Allah(swt) the whole time.&nbsp;
Doing this for a few days is great, but doing it&nbsp;&nbsp; forever would not be possible because the person&nbsp;
would either have to work or go to school. Allah&nbsp;&nbsp; (swt) wants us to be good Muslims, but he also&nbsp;
teaches us that we should have balance. That&nbsp;&nbsp; is why Prophet Muhammad (s) did not like that&nbsp;
Al-Hawlaa’(r) would never go to sleep at night. As Ramadan comes to an end, we will probably&nbsp;
not be able to do as much ibadah or worship&nbsp;&nbsp; as we did in Ramadan. This is fine&nbsp;
but it is important that we do not&nbsp;&nbsp; go completely back to how we were before&nbsp;
Ramadan. The point of Ramadan is that we&nbsp;&nbsp; can get closer to Allah(swt) and hopefully&nbsp;
become better Muslims than we were before. One way we can do this is to choose at&nbsp;
least one good did that we will do every&nbsp;&nbsp; day inshallah even if it’s something small.&nbsp;
Your goal could be to make dhikr every day,&nbsp;&nbsp; read the Quran for at least 5 minutes before you&nbsp;
go to sleep, donate even some coins every day,&nbsp;&nbsp; or do any good action. Inshallah this&nbsp;
will help us make good habits and will&nbsp;&nbsp; help us go to Jannah inshallah. Make&nbsp;
sure you make the most of these last&nbsp;&nbsp; couple of days of Ramadan and keep us in your&nbsp;
duas. And until next time, assalamualaikum &lt;3"
"Abu Bakr’s Secret Abu Bakr(r) was the last prophet, Muhammad(s)’s
best friend. He was one of the early Muslims and was a
kind and caring person from his young age. After Prophet Muhammad(s) passed away, the
Muslims chose Abu Bakr(r) as their next leader. So he became the first Caliph or Khalifah
of the Muslim Empire which is like a king. Even though Abu Bakr was like the king of
the whole Rashidun Caliphate, he lived in a very simple way and was always humble. When people from far away would come to Medina,
they could not tell that he was the Caliph because he seemed like everyone else. There is a story about Abu Bakr’s secret. Since Abu Bakr was the leader, he would lead
fajr prayer at the Prophet’s Mosque every day. One day Umar(r) noticed that Abu Bakr (r)
would never go home right after fajr. He would go far away by himself. Umar(r) was curious so one day he decided
to secretly follow him. After walking for a long he saw Abu Bakr(r)
go inside a very old house. Umar(r) was so confused. The sun rose and Abu Bakr was still in the
house! After a very long time, Abu Bakr finally got
out and started going back to his place. When Abu Bakr was far away, Umar(r) finally
got out of hiding and knocked on the door. A very old blind woman opened that door. Umar(r) asked about her situation and she
said that she was blind and had no one to take care of her. All of her children died and she had to take
care of her orphan grandchildren. Umar(r) asked who that man was who would come
every day to her house. The old woman said that she did not know who
that man was but she was very happy with him. Every day the man came and cleaned the house,
cleaned all of their clothes, made flour from the wheat, made the bread, their breakfast,
and then after everything was done, he would leave. Umar(r) was shocked! “Every day??” he asked. The woman said yes, every single day, subhanallah. This story teaches us about being humble,
kind, and helping others. Even though Abu Bakr was a busy king of the
Muslim Empire, Abu Bakr lived a simple life and stayed humble. His secret act of helping a blind, elderly
woman and her orphaned grandchildren every day shows us the importance of caring for
those in need quietly, without wanting anything in return no matter how powerful we become. In the Quran, 2:271, Allah says, ""To give
charity publicly is good, but to give to the poor privately is better for you, and will
remove your sins. And Allah is aware of everything you do."" Abu Bakr's example reminds us that true leadership
is not about power or money. It is about helping others with a kind heart. As Abu Bakr(r) once said, ""If you want the
blessings of Allah(swt), be kind to his people."""

"As you all know the corona virus is something that is very deadly. And because of that the entire world is asking
a very big question, “is the corona virus a punishment from the one and only God, Allah
(swt)""? We can find this answer from a Bukhari Sharif
Hadith which talks about plagues. Here Prophet Muhammad (s) said that Allah
(swt) gives punishment to certain people but at the same time he also saves others with
his mercy. Basically, any disaster that happens is because
of the bad people’s very big sins. But when a disaster comes, all of the good
and the bad people are affected. And that it becomes a very big warning to
the whole world. This is so we can all realize that without
our creator’s help, we are absolutely helpless. Think about it. This is the year of 2020. In the history of mankind, our world has never
been so advanced, especially in technology and medical science. Yet, so far we can’t do anything to stop
this. The whole world is trying their absolute best
to fight against this extremely tiny virus, which we can’t even see without a microscope. This reminds us that we cannot do anything
without Allah (swt)’s blessing. And seeing it is a reminder to really ask
ourselves, are we following our one and only God, Allah (swt)'s law and order? Do we even know what Allah (swt)'s orders
are? Have we truly read the meaning of the Quran? Now our second question is, how we can save
ourselves from this punishment? Now from the Quran and Hadith we can learn
the following things: No. 1 We need to understand that the corona
virus is a test from Allah (swt). We have to keep our belief in Allah (swt)
very strongly that only He can save us from this difficult time. No. 2 We should try to find medication for
this disease. No. 3 Muhammad (s)' ordered us to stay where
we are. In a situation like this we have to stay at
home to save ourselves and so that we can save others as well. Because the corona virus is very contagious. No. 4 Ask forgiveness from Allah (swt). We need to pray extra prayers and recite special
Duas to save us from this disease. And we also need to read the Quran with meaning
so that we can understand what Allah is trying to tell us. No. 5 Read Surah Fatihah, Falaq, Nas, Ayat
al Kursi, the last two verses from Surah Baqarah and 83 number ayah from surah Anbiya. In this time of a world wide virus that is
going on, we a planning to do a mini-series so that we can all remind ourselves some of
he most important plagues that happened at different times in history throughout the
different civilizations like Ancient Egypt, Greek, Rome, and more InshaAllah. And don’t worry, we are still working on
our upcoming project Rise of Islam! Inshallah it will come soon, right after we
complete this mini-series. In the meantime, we hope you enjoy this min
series while we work on the Rise of Islam project. Stay tuned and until next time, AssalamuAlaikum!"

"The life of Prophet Muhammad
( SAW ) is full of countless examples that show his status as a role model
for muslim society and the individuals His life is one that was
dominated by a superior morality Good habits Noble and gentle feelings
and superior skills All of which are characteristics that help prevent people from getting
 entangled in a web of sin The rich and the prosperous The poor and the needy The ruler and the ruled The weak and the lonely The conqueror and the victorious, commander The teacher and the student The preacher and the mentor The merchant and the craftman The employer and the employee In other words Every sort of person can
 find truth in Prophet's life that constitute an example
   for them to follow The rise of Islam is intrinsically
linked with the Prophet He was the choosen recipient And messenger of the word of God through the divine relevations  Muslims from all walks of life
strive to follow his example This is the series about the life
 of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (SAW ) One day while traveling North One of the Arab tribes from Mecca meet a
 hermit in the desert  Hermit were known to be wise  And the Arabs often asked their advice  Some of the men stopped to speak
with him and sought his council The hermit asked where they had come from They replied that they
were coming from Mecca He told them that Allah would soon sent a
 Prophet who would come from their people What would be the Prophet's name ?
One of them asked His name would be Muhammad
( SAW ) The hermit said that he would guide
 them to the new way of life The town of Mecca was an important
trading and religious centre for the people in Arabia Many of the tribes in the Arabian Peninsula
 at the time where nomadic trading goods as they
crisscrossed the desert The most famous sight was the Kaaba This is believed to have been
 build by Abrahim Alaihis Salam And his son Ismail Alaihis Salam Several trade route intersected at Mecca  Allowing the Quraysh to control
trade along the west coast of Arabia North to Syria And South to Yemen The power of the Quraysh derived
 from the role as successful merchants Abdul Mutalib was 70 year old and was
the foremost leader of the city of Mecca The people in the city loved
 and respected him very much Abdul Mutalib had a Son named Abdulla Who was a merchant by profession When Abdulla grew up He married Amina The daughter of Wahab The couple were so much in love
and time flew by Abdulla had to get back to his work So one day he bid goodbye
 to his loving wife He was a trader and he had to go on long trips
that would take months to complete But this time he was sad to leave
because Amina was pregnant And he wanted to be around his wife Abdulla was heading to the town of Hazza There was a caravan of
merchants waiting for him Long journeys  were difficult in those days people often feel sick and they die After a few months of traveling Abdulla feel sick while on his journey With lack of proper care
 he died within few days Amina was distraught
 when she heard the news She loved her husband dearly  And she couldn't believe
that he was no more In a few days she regained her strength as she waited the birth of her baby  During this time she 
dreamed of many things On one occasion it was as if a
 great light were shining out of her and on other she heard a voice telling her that she would have a boy And his name would be Muhammad She never forgot that voice
 but she told no one about it On monday the 12th day of Rabi’ al-Awwal
 in the year of the elephant Amina gave birth to a son Allah sends men many signs when
 one of his chosen Prophets is born And on that many such signs were seen Some were seen by jewish scholars who had read in the
scriptures of upcoming prophet One of the learned men Iniyatram
 for instance saw a brilliant new star He had never seen before
as he studied the heavens that night He called the people around him
pointing the star out to them And told them A Prophet must have been born Many miracles occured
in the sorrounding areas too At the time of his birth  All the idiols that were placed
 on the wall of Mecca fell down Several people witnessed
the falling of the idiols Including Abdul Mutalib
The grandfather of the Prophet The idiols remained on the floor
 for a whole 24 hours And any efforts to pick them up and direct
them throw out the wall was unsuccessfull The fire in the Magi temple
 of Zorwastrians  which had been alight
 for thousands of years quenched for the first time in the history The lake of Sawa is located in Kung
and Hamadan in modern day Iraq It was known as the city of evil doors But on the night of
 the birth of the prophet The lake which was vast enough for
 ships to sail through dried up entirely This was seened as a sign of Allah has 
Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam  empowered And a reminder to the people of Sawa to follow the path of righteousness Many other such miraculous incidents
 took place the night of Prophet was born The miraculous sign of his birth
are reminder that he is indeed the seal of the prophets That he was sent down as a mercy to mankind The night mark the beginning
of a new era in the world"
"Du'a 2: 201 Oh our Lord! Give us good in this world and good in the
life after our death and keep us safe from the Hell-Fire (2:201)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ What is our success? It is when we stay good in this world, so
that after our death, if we can go to the heaven. So how we can stay good in this world? If Allah (swt) keeps us safe from any kind
of bad things or evil things, then we are good. If Allah (swt) gives us all of our need in
this world, like food, home, health, education, family, peace, and respect, that means we
have our success in this world. But don’t we also want a good life after
our death? That is why we need Allah (swt)'s kind blessings
so we can go to heaven, InshaAllah. One day our prophet Muhammad (s) visited a
Muslim man who was very weak and sick. After seeing that man, Muhammad (s) wanted
to know, what he was asking from Allah (swt). That weak man said, he requested Allah (swt)
that, If there was any punishment for him, to give his punishment in this world and not
after his death, because really he wanted to go to the heaven. Muhammad (s) was surprised and said, no one
can carry Allah (swt)'s punishment. Then, he advised the weak man to ask Allah
(swt) for the good things in both this world and after his death. So, Muhammad (s) taught him this Du'a from
Surah Baqara, verse 201. With Allah (swt)'s blessing, in a short time,
the weak man felt better. It is such a powerful Du'a that Muhammad (s)
most of the time used this Du'a to get Allah (swt)'s blessing. So, don’t you think that we should memorize
this du'a to become successful in this world and after 
our death? Animal: Yes we should memorize this Dua!! MashAllah, that's very good. So then let’s memorize this Du'a today right
now. If you can memorize this Du'a by today, then
let us know in  our comment section below. Before we go, let’s repeat this Du'a together
five times. Ready? Alright!"
